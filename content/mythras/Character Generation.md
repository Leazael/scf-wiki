Characters will be generated using the usual Mythras character generation methods, except where noted otherwise.

# 1. Ancestry and Characteristics 
Choose an ancestry that fits with the character concept. Depending on the time and place within the setting some ancestries may be more or less suitable as player choices. In particular, Elves are incredibly rare, and Dwarves and Lizardfolk are rarely found outside of their own communities. 

Typical characteristics for each ancestry can be found in the following table:
![[Ancestral Characteristic Table]]
Characteristics are generated by taking the mean value from the last column and adding 10. This value is then distributed over the seven characteristics. The min and max value of the characteristics may not exceed the min and max that can be reached by the die rolls.

To derive heights and weights for non human characters, please consult the [[Heights and Weights]] rules.

# 2. Attributes
First, look up any racial abilities and modifications to attributes from [[Ancestral Abilities]] that may apply. Then calculate the character's attributes as usual.


# 3. Standard Skills
Calculate the characters standard skills as usual.


# 4. Culture 
Players are encouraged to select one of the [[Cultures]], and optionally one of the [[Subcultures]], appropriate to the setting. After choosing the culture:
- Apply all static bonuses.
- Select three professional skills form options offered.
- Optionally, select a single combat style appropriate to the culture.
- Allocate 100 points amongst the listed Standard Skills, the chosen Professional Skills and the Combat Style (if any).

Note that players are expected to create their own combat styles together with the GM.


# 5. Career 
While most of the standard careers listed in the Core Rules or Imperative are available, players are encouraged to come up with their own careers (made by combining seven standard skills or combat styles, and seven professional skills), such as:
- Alchemist
- Artificer
- Banker
- Natural Philosopher
- Hermetic Philosopher
- Miasma Worker 
- Thaumaturge
- Paladin

If you wish to play a career that makes use of magic, consult with the GM to create a tradition and skill set appropriate to the character and setting. If you wish to create a magical character, please consult with the GM to draft a suitable [[Magical Traditions|Magical Tradition]].


# 6. Age and Bonus Skill Allocation 
Every character gains an additional 150 points as normal during bonus skill allocation, and may allocate these with a maximum of 15 points per skill. 

These numbers are typical for a starting age as presented in the following table:
![[Starting Age]]

Of course, characters may choose to make a character that is significantly younger or older than the typical age. This simply means that the character has led a more eventful (if younger), or less eventful (if older) life than typical for their age and ancestry. Alternatively, younger characters may have acquired skills through some supernatural means, or perhaps a traumatic event for an older character has led to a loss in skill.

If a character wishes to make a character with significantly more or less experienced character, they must do so with the consent of the GM and the other players.


# 7. Background and Passions
Optionally, determine the characters Background evets, as well as the Social Class, Parents, Family Standing and Connections. Also determine the character's starting money from their social class.

Beginning are recommended to start with at least one, but up to to three Passions, each
based on two Characteristics, with a bonus of +40 to the first, +30 to the second and +20 to the third as per the Imperative Rules. 

It is recommended that at least one of these passions ties into the players [[Brotherhoods and Cults|brotherhood or cult]] (see below).


# 8. [[Brotherhoods and Cults]]
Players are recommended to join at least one [[Brotherhoods and Cults|brotherhood or cult]], as they will generally provide the only way by which characters may advance outside of the usual experience rolls. 

This is especially true for magical characters, as standing within a brotherhood and cult will determine access to new spells. (Unless the character decides to create their own tradition.)


# 9. Equipment
Determine starting equipment based on Social Class. Some modifications may be necessary depending on culture and setting.

Buy any additional equipment needed from the character's starting money.
