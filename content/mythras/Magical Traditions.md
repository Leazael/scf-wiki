Players who wish to embrace a magical tradition are encouraged to work one out together with the GM. Such a tradition will determine:
- What skills will be needed to cast spells.
- Whether ritualistic casting times apply to the tradition. 
- MP regeneration rules (typical regeneration is 1 MP/ day, but most traditions will have ways of increasing this.)
- What spells the character can select from.
