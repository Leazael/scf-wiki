# Iomedae
Iomedae is the chief [[God|deity]] of the [[Church of Iomedae]]. According the the [[Iomedaean Canon]], Iomedae was a mortal shield maiden, who lived roughly 2500 years ago, presumably on the [[Previous World]]. She came into godhood during a cataclysm that is unnamed in [[Iomedaean Canon|The Canon]], but it is generally agreed upon that it refers to the [[Rupture of the Æther]].

### Appearance
Wile no description beyond "shield-maiden" is given as part of the [[Three Lays]] or any part of the [[Iomedaean Canon]], she is generally depicted as a fair-skinned, red-haired, golden-eyed human maiden. In fact, this description of Iomedae is considered dogma by the [[Synodal Church of Iomedae|Synodal Church]].  

(It is even speculated that the reason that the [[Vahestan|original]] [[Arcadia|Arcadians]] decided to migrate to the [[Crucible]] fair-skin and red hair are far more common in these northern climates, which they considered auspicious. Another theory holds that some sailors had spotted the [[God|goddess]] son the shores of the [[Crucible]], and subsequently led their people there.)

When portrayed, she is usually clad in eater full-plate armour, or in white robes and a breastplate. In these depictions, she generally holds a sheathed sword aloft, or has a hilt protruding from her breast. Often , she and a  heavy shield displaying the [[Star of Iomedae]]. 

While this description is universally used throughout the [[Synodal Church of Iomedae|Synodal Church]], some [[Asynodal Churches of Iomedae|Asynodal Churches]] (especially those that adhere to the [[Heresy]] called [[Symbolic Iomedaeism]]) refrain from depicting her altogether, and even consider describing her as [[Human]] to be to limiting for a [[God|goddess]].

### Life
Virtually all that is known about Iomedae, as a person, is written down in the [[Three Lays|Lay of Steel]] and the [[Three Lays|Lay of Blood]]. The oldest versions of these books are roughly 1900 years old. 

Of these, the [[Three Lays|Lay of Steel]] is the most descriptive, giving various details about the foretelling and the birth of Iomedae and her early life as a shield-maiden.

The subsequent [[Three Lays|Lay of Blood]] details Iomedae's rejection of the existing [[God|gods]], and her assault on the heavens, backed by her [[Twelve Paladins]]. At the start of the raid she discards her [[Scabbard of Iomedae|Scabbard]], vowing to slay all [[God|gods]] who oppose her. Having conquered the heavens though, she finds herself still filled with righteous wrath, symbolised by her unsheathed sword, and thus unable to become the [[God|god]] that her people need. In her final act of mercy she sheathes her sword in her own blood and flesh. This sacrifice is what results in her final apotheosis.

### Godhood
Throughout the [[Three Lays|Lay of Stone]] she subsequently appears in increasingly divine apparitions to the surviving [[Twelve Paladins|Paladins]]. Here she guides the [[Saint|Saints]] in the founding of the [[Church of Iomedae|Church]]. She also hands down the [[Six Tenets]], relates the [[Nine Parables]] and listens to the [[Three Lays]], which move her to tears. 

With few exceptions, she does not directly interact with her followers, and usually acts through her [[Angel|Angelic]] messengers. The [[Angel|Angels]] closest tot the goddess are the [[Angel|Archangels]] who joined her during her assault on the heavens. They are traditionally named Zaphkiël, Sandalphon and Remiël.

### Differing Interpretations
While the above describes the mainstream beliefs related to the goddess, there are some who hold divergent beliefs. 

Some [[Asynodal Churches of Iomedae|Asynodal Churches]] belief in a [[Heresy]] called [[Symbolic Iomedaeism]], which holds that there never was a Mortal Iomedae, but that the concept of a Mortal Iomedae was created, and possibly endorsed, by the goddess to allow mortals to better comprehend her teachings. Alternatively, it gives mortals something to belief in, since the true nature of the immortal goddess would be incomprehensible.

The people of [[Tel Varesh]] consider the goddess to be the same as [[Primal Ancestors|Medua the Battlemaiden]], one of the [[Tel Varesh|Vareshian]] [[Primal Ancestors]].
