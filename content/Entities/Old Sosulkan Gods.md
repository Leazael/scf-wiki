Note: The Old [[Sosulka|Sosulkan]] [[God|gods]] form a pantheon heavily based on real world Slavic [[God|gods]], in particular those from the unified pantheon of Vladimir the Great. Players interested in these [[God|gods]] are encouraged to supply the information below with whatever research they find or fabricate.

The Old [[God|gods]] are a loose pantheon of [[God|gods]], also referred to as the [[God|gods]] of [[Izmoroz]] or the [[God|gods]] of the West. They are most often worshipped in westernmost parts of  [[Izmoroz]] and [[Las]]. These [[God|gods]] consist of a selection of local [[God|gods]] and nature spirits worshipped in the far north western corners of the [[Crucible]], often alongside or instead of the [[Æsir]] and [[Iomedae]]. 

## Beliefs
Those who worship the Old [[God|gods]] believe that these [[God|gods]] play an important part in the way the world works, with each [[God|god]] governing one or many aspects of existence. 

The main core of the pantheon consists of its chief deity, together Veles, Dazhbog, Stribog, Mokosh and Simargl. 

Perun: the thunder-[[God|god]] and [[God|god]] of war is the head of the pantheon. He is, among other things the [[God|god]] of thunder and lightning, earth and fire, mountains and wind, the oak and the iris-flower. He is sometimes identified with [[Æsir|Thor]].

Veles: the sometimes-enemy of Perun, a trickster-[[God|god]] that is also known as the Horned [[God]]. He is worshiped as a [[God|god]] of cattle and beast, magic and music, the wild forests and the underworld. He is sometimes identified with [[Æsir|Loki]].

Dazhbog: The [[God|god]] of the sun, conqueror of darkness, warrantor of justice and wellbeing. He changes from a young man to an old man as he travels the sky and is often accompanied by his two daughters, Zorya Utrennyaya the Morningstar, and Zorya Vechernyaya, the Eveningstar.

Stribog: [[God]] of winds and storms. He controls weather, bringing cold or mild winds to the Slavs that worked on their fields, bringing health to people, animals and fields. Stribog is a winged, darting, sharp, moody, stern, angry, short-tempered and grumpy [[God|god]]. He is usually described as an old man with white hair and long beard, with a golden bow in His hand and a horn that summons the winds. He is sometimes identified with [[Æsir|Odin]].

Mokosh: The Mother goddess of home and hearth, of corn and wetness and the patroness many crafts such pottery, spinning, weaving and woodworking.

Besides the [[God|gods]] mentioned above, many others are revered, such as Svarog, Radegast, Triglav, Svetovid and many others. Most villages and sometimes even families have a patron [[God|god]] that they may hold in high honour. 

## Structure
There is no central structure of the worship of the old [[God|gods]], aside from the great temple in [[Sosulka]]. Priests often function as healers and councillors to the [[Boyar]], and provide over many social events, such as births, marriages and funerals.

Priests usually take one or two apprentices during their lives, whom they teach both the mundane and magical aspects of priesthood. At the end of his or her training, an apprentice is supposed to know all the the rituals, and most of the tales, songs and poems that represent the religion.

## Symbols
The most popular symbols are the Hand of Perun and the Little Sun. These are often worn as a sign of prosperity or good luck.

## Events
While not specifically religious events, the solstices are usually celebrated. In addition, local spring and harvest festivals are also organized.

## Texts
The tales of the Old [[God|gods]] are transmitted verbally and may differ greatly from city to city, or village to village.
