aliases: [Medua the Battlemaiden, Stamoudsten]

A name for the five common ancestors of all inhabitants of [[Tel Varesh]] as well as many other noble families of the [[Vareshian Commonwealth]]. Their rites are practiced by the Masked Priests of the Primal Ancestors as part of the traditional [[Veneration of the Dead]].

One of these five ancestors is Medua the Battlemaiden, a figure often identified with [[Iomedae]], a fact that has led to some diplomatic friction between [[Tel Varesh]] and the [[Church of Iomedae]], and [[Arcadia]] by extension.
