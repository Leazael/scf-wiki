Angels are powerful celestial spirits native to the Heavens. They supposedly watch over mortals and are sometimes employed as messengers for various deities. 

# Angels of [[Iomedae]]
In the [[Crucible]], angels are strongly associated with the [[Church of Iomedae]]. These angels act as intermediates and messengers of [[Iomedae]] herself, and bestow her miracles on behalf of mortals that they have deemed worthy. Many priests in the leadership of the [[Church of Iomedae|Churches]] have forged strong alliances with an angel. Some orders are even consistently served by the same angel. For instance, the Priest-Regent of [[Arcadia]], currently [[Mary VIII]], is usually assisted by the Archangel Remiël.

The dogma of the [[Synodal Church of Iomedae|Synodal Church]], labels several angels as Archangels. These, usually four, angels are those to the [[Iomedae|godess]], and according to the [[Three Lays|Lay of Steel]], joined her during her assault on the heavens. They are traditionally named Michaël, Zaphkiël, Sandalphon and Remiël, and are traditianlly revered as greater [[Saint|Saints]] of the [[Church of Iomedae|Church]]

# [[Hermetic Philosophy|Hermetic]] Angels
Some angels have shown to be willing to be [[Transliminal magic|summoned]] as part of [[Hermetic Philosophy|Hermetic]] rituals. Most of these angels so [[Transliminal magic|summoned]] are supposedly associated with [[Iomedae]] and her [[Church of Iomedae|Church]], though may be more independent actors. 

The [[Synod]] officially opposes these practices, though their influence in the predominantly [[Asynodal Churches of Iomedae|asynodal]] [[University|Universities]] is limited.

# Empyreal Spirits
Angels, often referred to as Empyreal Spirits, also play a role in the the [[Veneration of the Dead|Ancestor Worship]] of [[Tel Varesh]], and occasionally in the practice of [[Thaumaturgy]]. 

The [[Masked Priests]] of the [[Primal Ancestors]] are known to "tame" Empyreal Spirits, and "bind" them to the service of the particular highly-placed families. Whether this is an act of coercion or whether there is some kind of deal involved is not known to the uninitiated.
