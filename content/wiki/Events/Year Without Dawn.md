The Year Without Dawn was a climate catastrophe that struck the[[Crucible]] for a 14 month period, from [[697 AF]] to [[698 AF]]. 

For the duration of the Year, harsh blizzards and freezing temperatures struck the [[Crucible]]. Allegedly, the sun was not visible for the entirety of the year, hence the "Year Without Dawn".

In the spring of [[698 AF]] it became clear that most of the northern reaches of [[Izmoroz]], were now virtually devoid of life, except for a few line cities who by then had sworn fealty to the newly arrived rules: the Ice [[Princesses of Las]]. The collection of city states are what is now the Forest Kingdom of [[Las]].

In subsequent years, [[Koschei the Deathless]] has attempted several timee to reclaim the cities formerly in his empire, however, each of thes attempts was met with grave disaster.
