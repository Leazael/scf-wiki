The Lethanian War of Separation, sometimes called the [[Polovina|Polovian]] Secession War, the Provincial War or simply the Great War, was a war that devastated the[[Crucible]] from the summer of [[1742 AF]] until the fall of [[1745 AF]]. 

The war started as a dispute between the [[Lethania|Lethanian]] provinces of [[Fenwald]] and [[Væringard]] on one side, and the southern provinces [[Yrsingen]], [[Hèrlmersc]] and [[Averion]] on the other side. The direct cause was a disagreement over the institution of [[Revelationary Revolution|Apocalyptic]] reforms in the wake of the [[Revelationary Revolution]].

Soon after the [[Lethania|South-Lethanian]] states declared their separation from the north, [[Arcadia]] allied itself with the more conservative [[Synodal Church of Iomedae||Synodal]] northern states. While [[Las]] as a country stayed neutral, both [[Pyelchek]] and [[Lagushka]] allied themselves with these states, forming the [[Allied Forces]].

Counter to this, [[Ilmbund]] quickly allied itself with the more [[Revelationary Revolution|Apocalyptic]] southern forces, together forming the [[Corridor]]. 

The war lasted for just over three years, and was abruptly ended by the sudden [[Cacotopic Warp|destruction of Holmgard]] in the autumn of [[1745 AF]]. A cease fire was instated, and before the end of the year, the warring nations all signed the [[Peace of Weißenfels]], officially ceasing hostilities and redrawing the map of the [[Crucible]] in many significant ways.

Most officially tallies put the death toll of the war in the low 20 millions, with just under 8 million dead soldiers, and the remainder civilians.


# The [[Natural Philosophy|Philosophical]] War 
The great war was notable for the deployment of many new [[Natural Philosophy|Philosophical]] weapons, especially by the [[Corridor]] forces. It was also the first war in which [[FIrearm|rifles]], grenades, artillery and other machine weaponry played a significant role.

Especially along the [[Ilmbund|Ilmian]]-[[Arcadia|Arcadian]] front, near the [[Myrk]] and the [[Dimmerwold]], the [[Great Guilds of Ilmbund|Great Guilds]] deployed many terrifying new weapons, ranging from powerful [[Miasma]]-bombs, to horrifying [[Alchemy|Alchemical]]-rain clouds. The most memorable of these attacks is the [[Rainbow Blaze of Aldsbury]], which nearly wiped the entire city of [[Aldsbury]] of the map.

The war also saw the first significant air-battles, mostly between the [[House Bern|Wyverns]] of the northern forces and the various airships and [[House Winselniß|anisopters]] of the [[Corridor]].


# The [[Church of Iomedae|Church]]
Despite the participation of the government of [[Arcadia]], the [[Synod]] itself remained neutral for the first few years of the war. In fact, the [[Bishop|Bishops]] made many attempts to negotiate cease-fires between [[Corridor]] and [[Allied Forces|Allied]] forces.

After repeated attempts of the [[Synod]] to influence [[Corridor]] policies, the [[Corridor]] officially distanced itself from the [[Synodal Church of Iomedae]], and officially declare themselves [[Asynodal Churches of Iomedae|Asynodal]], even putting [[Synodal Church of Iomedae|Synodal Churches]] within their borders under strict government supervision.


# Detailed Overview

In [[1731 AF]] the [[Revelationary Revolution]] that had broken out in [[Ilmbund]] the year before, reached the [[Lethania|Lethanian]] province of [[Yrsingen]]. Under these new [[Revelationary Revolution|apocalyptic]] influences, the provinces [[Yrsingen]], [[Averion]] and [[Hèrlmersc]], as well as the capital city of [[Holmgard]] quickly started democratizing. Furthermore, both [[Yrsingen]] and [[Hèrlmersc]] started rejecting the [[Synodal Church of Iomedae]] in favour of the newly founded [[Asynodal Churches of Iomedae]].

In [[1741 AF]], the winner of the [[Great Joust]] of [[1740 AF]], [[Vladimir Denris]] of [[Fenwald]] tried to revert some of the [[Revelationary Revolution|apocalyptic]] changes the south had instituted. This was, however, met with fierce resistance.

In [[1742 AF]] the south  [[Lethania|Lethanian]] provinces officially seceded, starting the [[Lethanian War of Separation]]. The southern provinces [[Hèrlmersc]], [[Yrsingen]] and West-[[Averion]] allied themselves with [[Ilmbund]], collectively known as the [[Corridor]]. Likewise, the [[Synodal Church of Iomedae|synodal]] provinces [[Væringard]] and [[Fenwald]] allied themselves with [[Arcadia]] to for the [[Allied Forces]]. Both [[Holmgard]] and [[Thurandir]] initially stayed neutral.

The war quickly devolved into a long, drawn out trench-war conflict, with the main trenches lying between [[Hèrlmersc]] and [[Væringard]], stretching from the [[Fomorian Mountains]] to [[Holmgard]], and a smaller secondary front between [[Maidenshrine]] and the [[Myriad Mountains]].

In [[1743 AF]], [[Thurandir]] loses its neutrality after an invasion by [[Fenwald]]. In the meanwhile, [[Ilmbund]] aggressively invades eastern [[Arcadia]] along the [[Myrk]]. The heavy bombing campaigned caused a catastrophic explosion at the [[Miasma]] refineries in [[Aldsbury]], leading to the [[Rainbow Blaze of Aldsbury]]. In the same period, mass fighting erupts in [[Holmgard]], with whole neighbourhoods barricading themselves and pitting themselves against other neighbourhoods. The fight is interrupted when [[Holmgard]] [[Cacotopic Warp|Pivots]] for the second time in history.

In the spring of [[1744 AF]], [[Dvårgheim|Dvårgian]] troops arrive in [[Thurandir|Thurandir’s]] capital [[Klingeborn]], and remove both [[Corridor]] and [[Allied Forces|Allied]] troops. With the fighters being forced out of the city, a second trench line is formed between between [[Klingeborn]] and [[Yrsingen]].

After repeated attempts of the [[Synod]] to influence [[Corridor]] policies, the [[Corridor]] officially distanced itself from the [[Synodal Church of Iomedae]]. Following this, the [[Holy Order of Paladins]] is officially deployed in order to drive [[Corridor]] troops out of [[Maidenshrine]]. 

While the [[Holy Order of Paladins|Paladins]] did not join the frontlines proper, they nonetheless played a crucial role in securing the borders of [[Arcadia]] for the remainder of the war.

In [[1745 AF]] the war abruptly ends when [[Holmgard]] [[Cacotopic Warp|Pivots]] again, this time permanently. With the loss of these millions of lives, all sides lay down their arms and the war ends with the signing of the [[Peace of Weißenfels]].
