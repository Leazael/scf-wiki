The crusades are a series of conflicts that took place between [[Arcadia]] and [[Nachýr]], with the occasional involvement of the surrounding countries, throughout the history of the [[Crucible]]. 

The most commonly cited cause was the practice of slavery throughout [[Nachýr]], an abomination according to the [[Six Tenets]] adhered to by the [[Church of Iomedae]].

# First Crusade
The first crusade started in [[822 AF]] during the end of the reign of [[Richaerd II]] and ended in [[831 AF]] under [[Henry II]]. 

The conflict was preceded by an economic boom within [[Nachýr]] due to increased trade between the dragon empire and the rest of the [[Crucible]]. However, due to the increased cultural contact, the worship of [[Tiamat]], the Dragon-Queen of [[Nachýr]] was slowly starting to spread out towards neighbouring countries. 

Many scholars city this increase in [[Tiamat]] worship as the true inciting factor of the first Crusade. The [[Bishop|Bishops]] of the [[Church of Iomedae|Church]], headed by [[Richaerd II]] set out with over a hundred thousand men and women in order to drive back the [[Nachýr|Dragon Empire]] from whence it came.

Although the [[Arcadia|Arcadian]] forces suffered some heavy losses and were ultimately unsuccessful in destroying the [[Nachýr|Empire]], they did manage to put an end to the constant advancement of the [[Nachýr|Empire’s]] borders. In [[831 AF]] the remaining armies of Arcadia returned home, now led by [[Richaerd II|Richaerd II’s]] only surviving son, [[Henry II]].

# Counter Crusade 
The Counter Crusade was a war, this time started by [[Nachýr]], that lasted from [[1017 AF]] until [[1021 AF]]. 

During this conflict, [[Tiamat]] herself led her troops to the borders of [[Arcadia]]. She also personally laid waste to many of [[Arcadia|Arcadia’s]] most crucial allies, most notably during the [[Ilm's Watch|Sack of Ilm's Watch]] in the winter of [[1018 AF]].

Having destroyed much of [[Arcadia]]'s forces, and having ruined the economies of the allied countries, [[Tiamat]] returned home. 

# Second Crusade 
The second crusade lasted from [[1199 AF]] to [[1211 AF]], and resulted in many of the [[Step-Stone Isles]] falling officially under [[Arcadia|Arcadian]] control.

# Third Crusade 
The third crusade lasted from [[1416 AF]] to [[1424 AF]] and is notable for the involvement of the Royal House of [[Ilmbund|Ilm]]. Despite the trauma suffered during the [[Ilm's Watch|Sack of Ilm's Watch]], the Royal House attempted to profit from the war effort by selling steel and iron to both sides of the conflict. 

This decision brought the contempt of the common people on the Royal House, who were already despised for their decadence. The people of [[Ilmbund|Ilm]], supported by the [[Arcadia|Arcadian]] [[Synod]], rebelled against their royalty in the Revolt of [[1423 AF]], an event known as the [[Ilmian Revolution]].

# The Fourth Crusade 
The fourth crusade lasted from [[1656 AF]] until [[1663 AF]]. It was ended after intervention of [[Ilmbund]] and [[Lethania]], who wished an end to the bloodshed. 

The [[Arcadia|Arcadian]] province of [[Averion]] is incorporated into the  [[Lethania|Lethanian]] Confederacy in order to create a larger buffer-zone between [[Arcadia]] and [[Nachýr]].

# Aftermath 
Despite no formal Crusade being issued, [[Arcadia]] and [[Nachýr]], the countries would remain in conflict until the vanishing of [[Tiamat]] and the [[Nachýrian Exodus]] in [[1768 AF]]-[[1769 AF]].

Some populist politicians within both [[Arcadia]], as well as [[Lethania]] have recently started co-opting Crusade like rhetoric in their attempts to remove the newly encroaching [[Kovold|Kobolds]] from their lands.
