The Silent War was a conflict between [[Ilmbund]] and [[Arcadia]] that lasted from [[1756 AF]] until [[1758 AF]].

The conflict started after a series of projectionist import/export policies led to tensions over the joined [[Miasma]] extraction venture undertaken by the two countries in the [[Myrk]]. A

After a series of escalating economic sanctions, and military exercises near the [[Arcadia|Arcadian]]-[[Ilmbund|Ilmian]] border, both countries started sending over special forces in order tot execute clandestine targeted economic and political missions in [[1756 AF]].

Despite the damage done to industrial complexes and infrastructure, neither country formally declared war, and civilian casualties stayed in the low hundreds.

After two years of conflict, the war abruptly ended when [[Ilmbund|Ilmian]] bombers managed to deploy to [[Swivelbomb|Swivelbombs]] on two of the uninhabited eastern-most [[Step-Stone Isles]]. 

After witnessing the horror, reminiscent of the [[Cacotopic Warp]], both parties formally ended hostilities (that were never formally begun.) Not long after, the [[Gabel Pact]] was drawn, ratifying the decision of the [[Philosophical Powers]] to cease all further research into [[Torque]] and forbidding the development of [[Swivelbomb|Swivelbombs]].
