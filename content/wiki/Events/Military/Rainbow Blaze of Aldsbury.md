The Rainbow Blaze was a great conflagration that occurred as a consequence of the intense bombing campaign during the [[Ilmbund|Ilmian]] invasion of [[Arcadia]] in [[1743 AF]], and nearly led to the destruction of the city of [[Aldsbury]].

This campaign, part of the [[Lethanian War of Separation]], started only minutes after [[Arcadia]] officially declared war on [[Ilmbund]]. The primary target of the bombing were the [[Arcadia|Arcadian]] [[Miasma]] installations in the [[Myrk]] swamps. 

One such installation was not just destroyed, but also led to the ignition of the entire [[Miasma]] deposit on which it rested. The initial blast collapsed all buildings and infrastructure in an 18 km radius, and caused great harm to the nearby city of [[Aldsbury]]. 

As the deposit burned away, the rainbow coloured flames could bee seen colouring the night sky for dozens of kilometres away. The conflagration lasted the best part of a month and caused irreparable damage to [[Arcadia|Arcadia's]] [[Miasma]] production capabilities.
