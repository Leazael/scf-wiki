An internal revolution within the kingdom of Ilm in 1423, leading to the founding of the Republic of Ilmbund.

Attempting to leech of the war effort, the Royal House of [[Ilmbund|Ilm]] tried to sell its steel and iron to both sides of the conflict, a decision that brought the contempt of the common people on the Royal House, who were already despised for their decadence. The people of [[Ilmbund|Ilm]], supported by the [[Arcadia|Arcadian]] [[Synod]], rebelled against their royalty in the Revolt of 1423 AF. After three decades of internal struggle in 1455, the power-vacuum was filled
by the Triumvirate, a joined council created by the three [[Great Guilds of Ilmbund]] (Being the Blacksmiths, the Stonemasons and the Carpenters). The nation was redubbed [[Ilmbund]] its largest city, [[SÃ¤len]], was made its capital.
