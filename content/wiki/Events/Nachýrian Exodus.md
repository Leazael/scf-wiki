The Nachýrian Exodus is a mass migration, comprising mainly [[Kovold|Kovolds]],  [[Lizardfolk|Kozarn]] and [[Human|Humans]], from [[Nachýr]]into the eastern [[Philosophical Powers]]. While the Exodus technically started in late [[1768 AF]], it did not gain momentum until early [[1769 AF]], when it started in earnest. 

The primary cause is the collapse of the [[Nachýr|Nachýrian]] power structure, and the effective destruction of the [[Nachýr|Nachýrian]] economy, itself caused by the extinction of the [[Nachýr|Nachýrian]] [[Serpentfolk|ruling class]] by the [[Withering Blossoms]]. Though less understood, the disappearance of [[Tiamat]] and coinciding death of [[Vahamut]] almost certainly plays an important role as well.

The Exodus has caused much political turmoil among the [[Crucible]] as political powers struggle to deal with the consequences of the mass migration. 

Of those countries, [[Lethania]], [[Izmoroz]], [[Ilmbund]] and [[Arcadia]] are most strongly affected. Only [[Polovina|Polovian]] has managed to keep the Exodus out, but only by applying great amount of deadly force. 

The Exodus has led to the creation of large slums outside of most of the major [[Philosophical Powers|Philosophical]] cities.
