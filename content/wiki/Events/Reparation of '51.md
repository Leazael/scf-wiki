The reunification of the [[Sosulkan Churches of Iomedae]] with the [[Orthodox Synodal Church of Iomedae]] within the [[Synodal Church of Iomedae]]. It happened in the wake of the death of [[Koschei the Deathless]] and his succession by [[Ivan I Czarovitch]].

After the death of Priest-King [[James IV]] and his succession by Priest-Queen [[Mary VIII]] in [[1737 AF]], many pro-apocalyptic reforms were passed. Unfortunately, these reforms led to the secession of several more conservative church member from [[Las]] and [[Izmoroz]], that united as the [[Sosulkan Churches of Iomedae]], an event often called the [[Secession of '37]]. 

The remaining [[Arcadia|Arcadian]], [[Polovina|Polovian]]  and [[Lethania|Lethanian]] [[Bishop|Bishops]] have been dubbed the [[Orthodox Synodal Church of Iomedae]].
