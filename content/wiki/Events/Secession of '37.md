A split in the [[Synodal Church of Iomedae]] in the wake of the [[Revelationary Revolution]].

After the death of Priest-King [[James IV]] and his succession by Priest-Queen [[Mary VIII]] in [[1737 AF]], many pro-apocalyptic reforms were passed. Unfortunately, these reforms led to the secession of several more conservative church member from [[Las]] and [[Lizardfolk]], that united as the [[Sosulkan Churches of Iomedae]], an event often called the Secession of '37. 

The remaining [[Arcadia|Arcadian]], [[Polovina|Polovian]]  and [[Lethania|Lethanian]] [[Bishop|Bishops]] have been dubbed the [[Orthodox Synodal Church of Iomedae]].  It was not until [[1751 AF]] that the western Sosulkan Bishops were formally reinstituted in the [[Synod]] during the [[Reparation of '51]].
