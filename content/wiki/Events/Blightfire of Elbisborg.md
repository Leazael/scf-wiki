The Blightfire of [[Elbisborg]] was a wildfire that started on the [[Alchemy|Alchemical]] dumping grounds of the [[College of Elbisborg]] sometime in the summer of 1707 AF. It's many coloured flames burned for weeks on end, and its smoke was responsible for the outbreak of the disease known as the [[Altpox]].

Due to this, the [[Alchemy|Alchemists]] of the [[College of Elbisborg|College]] are still met with some suspicion.
