Celestial is one of the few known truly [[Ancient Languages]]. It is the language used for the original [[Iomedaean Canon]], and as such is still taught to students of the [[Church of Iomedae]]. Sessions of the [[Synod]] still use Celestial as a lingua franca.

The [[Orkish]] and [[Niyezian]] languages use a right-to-left transposition of the Celestial alfphabet, but do not share its grammar or pronunciation.
