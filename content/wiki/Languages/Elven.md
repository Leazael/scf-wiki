Elven is the language spoken by the [[Elf|Elves]]. It was supposedly the main language of [[Cinis|EldedeÃ«l]], and is in all probability still spoken on[[Elsar]] by the [[Grey Elf|elves]] who reside there.

The language was still taught at the [[Shining Academy]] before it closed its gates in 1726 AF.

Some scholars have traced several lemma's in the language of [[Niyezian]] back to elvish roots.
