Orkish refers to the language spoken by [[Half-Ork|Half-Orks]] of the [[Crucible]]. The language itself is mostly derived from [[Sosulkan]] with [[Ildarin]] influences, while using a right-to-left transposition of the [[Celestial]] alphabet.

While the language shares its pronunciation, and many lemmas with [[Niyezian]], it does not share the [[Tel Varesh|Vareshian]] language's same [[Elven]] roots.
