Lingua Alta was the language of the [[Shining Academy]]. It was the main language used for communication between the [[Bondsmage|Bondsmagi]] and is in all likelihood as old as the Academy itself. 

The language was often employed by early [[Natural Philosophy|Philosophers]] and still permeates the language used by [[Alchemy|Alchemists]] and [[Hermetic Philosophy|Hermetic Philosophers]]. It was supposedly also used during ceremonies of the [[Guild of Stonemasons]].

The language is still taught at the [[Exalted School of Tel Varesh]], and early contact between [[Tel Varesh]] and the [[Crucible]] occasionally used Lingua Alta as a common language.
