Yrsingen is mainly known for being the home of [[Weißenfels]], and its university, the [[Academy of Weißenfels]]. After the [[Lethanian War of Separation]] it was further expanded with territories formerly belonging to [[Thurandir]], including [[Klingeborn]] where much of [[Lethania|Lethania’s]] steel production is housed.

Yrsingen was the first [[Lethania|Lethanian]] province affected by  the [[Revelationary Revolution]] and the first to abolish its feudal system in favour of a regional parliament,

In recent times it has been discovered that in the [[Myriad Mountains]], which separate [[Lethania]], [[Ilmbund]] and [[Arcadia]] are one of the rare sources of raw [[Mythril]]. 

The former ruling [[House Winselniß]], is known for their large mechanical anisopters (dragonflies).
