The Step-stone isles is the name for the archipelago dividing the Shimmering Straights from the [[Wilted Ocean]] and the [[Our-Valiant-Lady Sea]].

The westernmost isles are controlled by [[Lethania]] and contain the port city of [[Eydesburg]]. The eastern isles are controlled by [[Arcadia]] and contain the port cities of [[Providence]] and [[Sallysport]].

Throughout most of the [[Crusade|Crusades]] and thereafter, the isles were disputed between [[Arcadia]] and [[Nach√Ωr]], but after the intervention of [[Lethania]] in [[1728 AF]] - [[1729 AF]] they became a [[Lethania|Lethanian]] owned buffer zone between the constantly warring powers.

The eastern-most isles were violently shaken by the testing of [[Swivelbomb|Swivelbombs]] in [[1758 AF]], which ended the [[Silent War]] and led to the [[Gabel Pact]].
