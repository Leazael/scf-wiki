The Lethanian Colonies refer to two areas on the south-[[Nachýr|Nachýrian]] coast, and the two cities that have sprung up in their respective centres, [[New Holmgard]] and [[Fort Arkys]].

The first colony was established by Lianna [[House Arkys|Arkys]], who bough the land from [[Tiamat]] in 1614. The small fort that she build dubbed [[Fort Arkys]], was primarily used as a trading post, allowing [[Lethania|Lethanian]] ships to dock, and buy up large quantities of spices and resins, especially shellac. 

After the discovery of large [[Kavorinium|Kavorite]] deposits in the 1730s, the colonies quickly expanded in order to support new mining operations and [[Kavorinium]] production plants. 

As trade between [[Tel Varesh]] and [[Lethania]] grew in scale, the colonies also proved an important midpoint for ships passing between the [[Crucible]], the [[Vareshian Colonies]] and the [[Vareshian Commonwealth]]. 

# Population 
Originally, the populations of [[Fort Arkys]] and [[New Holmgard]] used to consist mainly of [[Human]] workers from [[Lethania]], and sometimes [[Polovina]], [[Ilmbund]] and even [[Arcadia]]. Often these people were on fixed contracts to do relatively skilled labour for a period of 5-10 years, after which they would return back home. 

More recently though, more and more people have permanently moved to the colonies, and the settlements have grown to proper cities in their own right. Second and even thrid generation colonist now comprise almost half of the population. 

Naturally, both cities also boast sizable populations of native [[Kovold|Kovolds]] and [[Lizardfolk|Kozarn]] and away from the cities, the native [[Nachýr|Nachýrians]] vastly outnumber their colonisers.

The Lethanian colonies are also home to small communities of exiled of ostracised [[Ork|Orks]] from the [[Vareshian Commonwealth]], or [[Tel Varesh|Vareshians]] simply have decided to emigrate.

Perhaps surprisingly, the [[Nachýrian Exodus]] has not led to a large increase in [[Kovold]] population. However, the lack of traditional power structures in the wake of the [[Withering Blossoms]] has led to more [[Kovold|Kovolds]] finding careers in more "[[Lethania]]" careers, such as the navy, or the [[Kavorinium]]-production plants.

# The [[Murænes]]
Due to its proximity to [[Murænia]] on the other side of the [[Tagelsea]], [[New Holmgard]] especially has seen relatively frequent attacks or incursions from the [[Murænes]]. These attacks often take the form of twisted [[Undead]] [[Human|Humans]] simply walking out of the sea and attacking whatever is in their path. Sometimes these attacks are accompanied by strange [[Magic|magics]].
