The Lethanian colonies is an area on the far west coast of [[Nach√Ωr]], west of the [[Ten-Thousand-Teeth Sea]]. The colonies are centred on the port-city of Kef Hattikvah, which was bought from [[Tiamat]] in the late 1600s, in order to establish a half-way port between the [[Lethania|Lethanian]] [[Lethanian Colonies|Colonies]] and the cities of the [[Tel Varesh|Vareshian]] [[Vareshian Commonwealth|Commonwealth]].

The colonies themselves are mainly used for the production of spices, resins and dyes, in larger quantities than can be done using traditional [[Vareshian Commonwealth|Vareshian]] farming methods.

Kef Hattikvah and its surrounding areas fall officially under the domain of the navy of [[Kef Zayem]] and its [[Witch Marshal]]. 

Its population consist for a large part of [[Kovold|Kovolds]] and [[Lizardfolk]] indentured under Vareshian rule. The colonies also house many [[Ork|Orks]] who have chosen to live under exile, or are otherwise ostracised due to matters of honour.
