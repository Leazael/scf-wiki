The Cacotopic Warp is the name given to [[Holmgard]] and its surrounding areas ever since the place "pivoted" for the third (and to date, final) time in [[1745 AF]].

This "pivoting" was described as a city-wide misotropic event, that caused widespread panic, and did irreparable damage to the city's infrastructure. Eye-witness accounts describe synchronous hodokinetic patterns, that not only involved the entirety of [[Holmgard]]'s population, but also altered its roads and pathways in strange and poorly understood ways.

Two decades later in [[1743 AF]], at the height of the [[Lethanian War of Separation]], [[Holmgard]] pivoted again. This time large parts of the city became permanently warped to the point of inhabitability. It also forced the last of the remaining [[Lethania|Lethanian]] government to permanently relocated to [[Eldmere]].

Two years later in [[1745 AF]], [[Holmgard]] pivoted for the third and final time, rendering both the city and its surrounding hostile to all forms of life. 

## Properties 
The cacotopic warp is a roughly circular area with a diameter between 80 - 120 km, centred roughly on the former city centre of [[Holmgard]], where the [[Drys]] and [[Thryr]] rivers meet. 

Very few have dared to travel through the Cacotopic Warp, though some smuggleres still use the [[Thryr]] and [[Drys]] as very dangerous trade routes. THey usually operate using special barges, and seal themselves inside for the duration of the journey through the warp 

The rare and few eyewitness accounts report on the appearance of circles of standing stones, and the sound of screaming voices on the air.

## Consequences 
The Warp was an event of such a magnitude that it immediately brought an end to the [[Lethanian War of Separation]], as neither party was willing to believe that the other would go as far as destroy all of [[Holmgard]]. The [[Peace of Weißenfels]] was signed later the same year.

In [[1746 AF]], the nation of [[Dvårgheim]] proclaimed [[Ragnarǫk]], citing the Warp as clear evidence of the end of the world. The country stayed in lock-down for 14 years after.

The appearance of the warp instigate a great collapse in [[Lethania|Lethanian]] infrastructure, that the train network, already damage and under-maintained because of the [[Lethanian War of Separation|war]], was ill equipped to mitigate. Nonetheless, in the years following the warp, construction was begun on the [[Ruynvaart]], between [[Ruynwold]] and [[Alpenkreis]], which has made safe river travel possible again.

The Warp itself has led to many conspiracy theories, relating ti its origin. Many have blamed the [[Guild of Stonemasons]] or even the [[Bondsmage|Bondsmagi]].

## [[Torque]]
It has been hypothesized by [[Natural Philosophy|Philosophers]], but not proven, that the power behind the Pivoting and the Warp is in fact [[Torque]], the same [[Elementary Philosophical Forces|force]] that powers the dreadful [[Swivelbomb|Swivelbombs]].
