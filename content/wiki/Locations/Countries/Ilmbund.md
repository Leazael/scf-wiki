# Summary
Ilmbund is a large country on the eastern side of the [[Crucible]]. Is currently ruled by its parliament, with [[Great Guilds of Ilmbund|Guidlmasters]] acting as an overseeing organ. The [[Triumvirate of Ilmbund |Triumvirate]], being the three guildmasters of the [[Great Guilds of Ilmbund|Great Guilds]], form the official head of state.

The capital of Ilmbund is the city if [[Sälen]], which is notable from having a separate (highly capitalist / plutocratic / kleptocratic) code of law and tax-code form the rest of the country. The primary language is [[Ildarin]]. It is considered one of the [[Philosophical Powers]]

In recent years, after the events leading up to and including the [[Thanatogenic Ghost Storm]] in 1761, the country has expanded past the [[Raubmaul]] into what was formerly [[Yádor]]. The  [[Echsee]] in particular has in the last decade swiftly grown from a colonial encampment to a prosperous city.

# History
The history starts with that of the ancient city that gave it its name: [[Ilm's Watch]]. The prosperity that followed the founding of the state of [[Lethania]] in 0 AG, led to the growth that caused the city-state of [[Ilm's Watch]] to expanded greatly as well. In 230 AF, the city pronounced its hegemony over the neighbouring petty kingdoms and became the newly founded kingdom of Ilm.

By the 800s, the kingdom of Ilm had almost fully converted to the [[Church of Iomedae]]. It was not a suprise then, that when [[Arcadia]] launched the first [[Crusade]] in 822 - 831 AF, that Ilm was one of its staunchest allies. 

Slow to respond, [[Nachýr]] launched its counter [[Crusade]] in1017 AF., a conflict that would last until 1021 AF. Not only did Tiamat march in force upon [[Arcadia]], she also personally laid waste to many of [[Arcadia|Arcadia’s]] most crucial allies, most notably during the [[Ilm's Watch|Sack of Ilm's Watch]] in the winter of 1018 AF.

In the wake of the [[Ilm's Watch|Sack of Ilm's Watch]], the city was utterly destroyed. What remained of the royal family settled in [[Dimmerschluß]].

During the third [[Crusade]] (1416 AF to 1424 AF), while attempting to leech of the war effort, the Royal House of [[Ilmbund|Ilm]] tried to sell its steel and iron to both sides of the conflict, a decision that brought the contempt of the common people on the Royal House, who were already despised for their decadence. 

The people of [[Ilmbund|Ilm]], supported by the [[Arcadia|Arcadian]] [[Synod]], rebelled against their royalty in the Revolt of 1423 AF. After three decades of internal struggle in 1455, the power-vacuum was filled by the [[Triumvirate of Ilmbund]], a joined council created by the three [[Great Guilds of Ilmbund]] (Being the Blacksmiths, the [[Guild of Stonemasons]] and the Carpenters). The nation was redubbed [[Ilmbund]] its largest city, [[Sälen]], was made its capital.

Although the mounted raiders from [[Yádor]] had always been a nuisance to the lands of Ilmbund, they were never an outright threat. That is, until the Invasion of 1585 AF. A great horde of [[Human|Humans]] and [[Halfling|Halflings]] passed through the gap between the [[Göllnyr Mountains]] and the [[Wavering Mountains]]. Led by [[Váida Khan]], the great Halfling clan-leader, the raiders managed to penetrate deep into [[Ilmbund|Ilmian]] territory. Through a joint effort of [[Ilmbund|Ilmian]], [[Arcadia|Arcadian]] and [[Lethania|Lethanian]] forces, these barbarians were finally pushed back in the summer of 1586 AF.

At the [[Treaty of Ölmfurt]] it was decided that henceforth, each of these countries would supply part of a standing army, meant to keep the [[Yádor|Yádorians]] from invading by force. Stationed at the newly erected fortress at [[Raubmaul]].

In 1663, Ilmbund together with [[Lethania]] brought an end to the fourth [[Crusade]], with the Ilmian-Lethanian armies forcing the [[Arcadia|Arcadian]] forces back to their borders.

In the years following, Ilmbund, together with Lethania start rapidly modernizing, effectively kicking of an industrial revolution. Soon, in 1704, the Guild of Blacksmiths is replaced by the [[Guild of Alchemists]] as one of the [[Great Guilds of Ilmbund]] in the [[Triumvirate of Ilmbund]]. Only a few years later a new upheaval takes place when the [[Guild of Clockworkers]] similarly replaces the Guild of Carpenters.

In the wake if the [[Miasma]] strikes in [[Hèrlmersc]], in the early months of 1730, Ilmbund decides to reach out to [[Arcadia]] in order to jointly exploit the recently discovered [[Miasma]] sources in the [[Myrk]] delta. However, the strikes quickly spread to the [[Myrk]] as well and make their way into the capital, [[Sälen]].

Near the end of 1730, the strikes and protests kick of the [[Revelationary Revolution]] with the [[Twelve-Day War]]. During this twelve day event, the [[Great Guilds of Ilmbund]] were stormed by disgruntled protestors, the autocracy of the [[Triumvirate of Ilmbund]] was dismantled, a parliament was instated and limited suffrage (i.e., for all adults with *a* guild membership) was adopted.

As a consequence of the [[Revelationary Revolution]], the [[Asynodal Churches of Iomedae]] become ever more popular in Ilmbund. Hence, it was nu surprise that Ilmbund sided with South-[[Lethania]], (collectively known as the [[Corridor]]) against [[Polovina]] and [[Arcadia]] during the [[Lethanian War of Separation]] (1742 - 1745).

A decade later (1756 - 1758), Ilmbund and [[Arcadia]] were involved in a cold war, also called the [[Silent War]], that ended after Ilmbund half-successfully tested two of its [[Swivelbomb|Swivelbombs]] in 1758. The original cause was a series of escalations that started with a trade dispute regarding the exploitation of the [[Myrk]] swamp in Arcadia, where a significant [[Miasma]] deposits was found. The [[Gabel Pact]] brought an official end to the [[Silent War]].

Three years later, in 1761, [[Ilmbund]] was invaded by [[Yádor|Yádorian]] nomads. However, unaware of the recent [[Natural Philosophy|philosophical]] innovation, and expecting knights on horseback, the [[Yádor|Yádorians]] were mercilessly slaughtered. The resulting mass-death caused the [[Thanatogenic Ghost Storm]] that slowly spread over Ilmbund until in 1762 the [[Asynodal Churches of Iomedae]] received aid from the [[Synod]] and the ghosts were banished.

# Races
The population of the Lethania consists for the most part of [[Human|Humans]]. As nearly everywhere, [[Elf|elves]] and [[Half-Elf|half-elves]] are rare.  Since the [[Nachýrian Exodus]] in 1769 a sizable minority of [[Kovold|Kobolds]] has entered the country and are living in encampents and slums outside of many large cities. 

Ilmbund's cities also house large population of [[Gnome|Gnomes]], often sequestered into their own dense interconnected sub-cities.

Ilmbund is where both the train network started and where the [[Facsimile Machine]] was invented.


# Religion
The majority of Ilmbund's population supported the [[Revelationary Revolution|Apocalyptic Movement]] hence most of its population is a member of one of the [[Asynodal Churches of Iomedae]]. Most of these churches abide by the [[Dimmerschluß Creed]], but exceptions are not uncommon.

The [[Synodal Church of Iomedae]] was outlawed, until the reconciliation in 1762 in the aftermath of the [[Thanatogenic Ghost Storm]].

In some of the larger cities, religion has fallen out of fashion. Many of these cosmopolitan atheists describe themselves as being [[Alatrism|alatristic]].

With the advent of the [[Nachýrian Exodus]], [[Vahamut]] is commonly worshiped by the [[Kovold|Kobolds]] that have entered the country.


# Politics

Ilmbund is government by a parliament. This parliament is ostensibly elected by the tax-payers of Ilmbund, which, in-particular in the large cities, means that being able to vote requires substantial bribes to the right government officials. 

The official heads of state are the [[Triumvirate of Ilmbund]], consisting of the guild masters of the three [[Great Guilds of Ilmbund]], being the [[Guild of Alchemists]], the [[Guild of Clockworkers]] and the [[Guild of Bankers and Brokers|Broker's Guild]]. The latter displaced the [[Guild of Stonemasons]] in the wake of the [[Revelationary Revolution]] and the [[Twelve-Day War]] of 1730. The [[Guild of Stonemasons]] has since been outlawed, but lives on as a secret underground secret society.

[[Ilmbund]] has long had close ties with [[Lethania]]. In the aftermath of the [[Silent War]] (1756 - 1758)) ties with [[Arcadia]] have been somewhat repaired and the joint exploitation of the [[Myrk]] swamp has been resumed.

Its government can be described as [[Natural Philosophy|philosophically]] progressive, capitalist and plutocratic.
