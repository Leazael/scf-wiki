# Summary
The Vareshian Commonwealth is country on the [[Widdersin Ocean]], west of [[Izmoroz]], and to the north and east of [[Nachýr]]. The country is in actuality a loose alliance of different city-states, that are ruled under hegemony by the city of [[Tel Varesh]] since time immemorial. The country itself is bisected into a northern and southern province by the [[Gulf of Varesh]].

The Commonwealth boasts a majority population of [[Ork|Orks]], often referred to as [[Half-Ork|Half-Orks]] by [[Crucible|easterners]].  The remaining population consists of equal parts [[Human|Humans]], mostly descendants from [[Izmoroz|Izmorozian]] immigrants, and a native population [[Halfling|Hobgoblins]], who are often treated as second class citizens at best.

The Commonwealth still has a strong [[Magic|Magical]] tradition, partly due to the symbiotic relationship [[Tel Varesh]] enjoyed with its embassy of [[Bondsmage|Bondsmagi]]. Their magical tradition, referred to as [[Thaumaturgy]], is usually reserved for the gentry, and is taught primarily at the [[Exalted School of Tel Varesh]].

Perceived honour plays a large roll in Vareshian society, especially in high-society, which functions by many complicated and highly ceremonial rules. Those who break these rules will often exile themselves, or be ostracised by their families, rather than bring shame upon their house.


# History
The Commonwealth has existed in some form or another for the last 2000 years, and the [[Ork|Orks]] of [[Tel Varesh]] claim a direct lineage from the [[Previous World]] through the [[Primal Ancestors]].

The Commonwealth has only recently come into direct contact with the [[Crucible]], with formal contact being established only in the mid 1600s, during the first wave of [[Lethania|Lethanian]] [[Lethanian Colonies|colonaisation]] of [[Nachýr]]. The increased trade between [[Lethania]], and to a lesser degree [[Arcadia]], even led to the establishment of the [[Vareshian Colonies]], which were largelty created to serve as a way point between the [[Lethanian Colonies]] at [[Fort Arkys]] and [[Tel Varesh]] proper.

The increase in traffic between the Commonwealth and the [[Crucible]] through the [[Tagelsea]] is probably what provoked the [[Murænes]], leading to the [[Massacre of Eldmere]] and similar, though less devastating, attacks on [[Zaar Godot]] and [[Tel Varesh]] itself in 1754 AF. These attack further strengthened the bond between [[Lethania]] and [[Tel Varesh]], leading to opening of the first Vareshian embassy in the [[Crucible]] in that same year.

Together with the [[Lethania|Lethanian]] navy, the Commonwealth would mount several [[Lethanian-Vareshian Expeditions|expiditions]] to discover the source of the attacks, leading to the discovery of the under water cities near [[Murænia]] in 1756. Further retaliatory joint [[][[Lethanian-Vareshian Expeditions|expeditions]] would be mounted expeditions in 1757, 1759 and 1764. 

# Races 
Roughly two thirds of the population of the Commonwealth consists of [[Ork|Orks]]. The [[Human]] population, consisting mostly of rural [[Izmoroz|Izmorozian]] immigrants are usually granted full citizenship. The native population of [[Halfling|Halflings]], usually referred to as [[Goblin|Hobgoblins]] are usually treated as second class citizens. In fact, in [[Tel Varesh]] has forbidden [[Halfling|Hobgoblins]] without the right papers from living above the bridges, forcing the [[Halfling]] population into half-floating slums tacked onto the underside of the city.

The [[Nachýrian Exodus]] has to a lesser extent also affected the Commonwealth, though less severely than in the [[Crucible|east]]. Many of the migrating [[Kovold|Kovolds]] have managed to make a home inside the cities itself, and are often treated better than the [[Halfling|Hobgoblins]]. The migrating [[Lizardfolk]] especially have found a niche in [[Tel Varesh]], as they are naturally strong swimmers, and are often unaffected by the [[Carrion Squid]].

# Religion
The people of the Commonwealth usually practice [[Veneration of the Dead]], with most houses having small shrines, or even independent chapels dedicated to dead family members. In [[Tel Varesh]]. 

Most families will keep a tomb of ossuary, usually in one of the bone-orchards outside of the city. The very rich will often maintain an ossuary in the city proper, and may even have the tomb guarded by the [[Undead|undead]] remains of esteemed family members. The [[Necromancy|necromantic]] [[Magic|magics]] are usually performed by the members of the [[Masked Priests|Masked Priesthood]].

The city of [[Tel Varesh]] also reverses a group of common ancestors called the [[Primal Ancestors]]. Most ancient families of [[Tel Varesh]], and the commonwealth in general, will claim descendance from one of the five ancestors, and may even boast of keeping some of their bones in their family ossuary. 

# Politics
Each city in the Commonwealth has its own idiosyncratic power structure: 
- [[Tel Varesh]] is ruled by lottery, where the number of lots a particular family can submit is determined by a complicated system of honour, tradition and political manoeuvring.
- [[Kef Zayem]] is ruled by a military government, traditionally headed by its most powerful general-[[Thaumaturgy|Thaumaturge]], the [[Witch Marshal]].
- [[Zaar Godot]] and [[Myr Carmot]] are ruled by councils of land-owning Princes (a gender neutral term in this context.)
- [[Vered Magal]] boasts a system of direct democracy, (older by far than the inchoate democracies of the [[Crucible]]), where all tax payers can participate in voting and policy formation. 

Nonetheless, all cities accept [[Tel Varesh]] as its first-among-equals, and in international conflicts, [[Tel Varesh]] speaks with the voice of the Commonwealth.
