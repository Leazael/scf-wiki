Førnheller is the oldest city of [[Dvårgheim]], it situated in a vast underground series of caverns underneath the [[Göllnyr Mountains]], on the shores of an underground lake.

Its population mainly consists of [[Dwarf|dwarves]], who make up roughly 80% of the population, and [[Gnome|Gnomes]] who make up roughly 15%. Most of its human population does not live in the city permanently, but only for short intervals, migrating between the city and one of the many towns that dot the [[Göllnyr Mountains]]. This traffic is made possible by the large system of trains and elevators that connect the city to the surface.

Førnheller has traditionally exported large quantities of Iron and Copper to the surface, though in recent years, it has added [[Kavorinium]] ore to that list.

While was city from which [[Dvårgheim]] was founded ([[141 AF]]), it is not the capital of the country.

It is said that the [[King Under the Mountains]] resides deep underneath Førnheller.
