Elbisborg is the oldest city in the nation of [[Ilmbund]], though it was younger than the city of [[Ilm's Watch]] before its sacking in [[1018 AF]]. The city is build against the edge of the [[Göllnyr Mountains]], not far from the borders of [[Dvårgheim]].

The city is famous for the great [[Walls of Elbisborg]], which delineate the centres of the city from its sprawling suburbs.

The city is home to the [[College of Elbisborg]] which is the oldest of the [[University|Universities]] in the [[Crucible]] (though younger still than the [[Exalted School of Tel Varesh]]). 

Possibly due to the interference of the [[Alchemy|Alchemists]] of the [[College of Elbisborg|College]], the city is home to several strange species that cannot be found elsewhere in the forge. Among these species are the [[Snicket Owl|Snicket Owls]] and [[Sucker-Ivy]].

The citizens of the city often carry one or more smaller mutations, sucks as small patches of feathers, scales, extra digits or stranger alterations, as a consequence of the disease known as the [[Altpox]]. This disease plagued the city after the [[Blightfire of Elbisborg|Blightfire]] in [[1707 AF]]. Though non-communicable Its effects still mark the descendants of those affected by it, nearly 70 years later.
