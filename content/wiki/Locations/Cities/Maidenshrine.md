A city in western [[Arcadia]], also known as Magdenschrein in [[Ildarin]]. From [[1663 AF]] to [[1745 AF]], the city was part of the [[Lethania|Lethanian]] province [[Averion]]. It originally came under [[Lethania|Lethanian]] rule in the aftermath of the Fourth [[Crusade]], but re-joined [[Arcadia]] under the stipulations of the [[Peace of Wei√üenfels]], after the [[Lethanian War of Separation]].

The city has, since the time of the found of [[Arcadia]], been ruled by [[House Brightshield]].
