Miasma is a heavy luminescent gas that can be found beneath the bogs and mires of the [[Hèrlmersc]] and the [[Myrk]] and is primarily used as a highly efficient energy source in many [[Natural Philosophy|philosophical engines]]. More mundanely, miasma has also become popular as a fuel for highly compact and efficient new lamps and other appliances.

Miasma can be easily recognized by its vibrant colours, alternating randomly between vibrant swirls of turquoise and fuchsia. Although miasma can be seen in the dark, it typically does not provide much light. A 50Bml vial of miasma sheds significantly less light than a typical candle.

Ever since the development of the first Miasma-wicks in [[1634 AF]], [[Natural Philosophy|Philosophers]] have found a myriad of applications for miasma. Most notably, the substance can be used to apply a great amount of heat in a very short amount of time, thus enabling engineers to start up their steam-engines in a fraction of the time it would take conventional fuels.

It has also been used as a propellant in several more exotic siege-weapons, and as a power source for many other quaint and curious devices. In recent years, miasma has become commonly available with more and more houses and even street-lights being lit by the substance. Miasma lamps shed a harsh white-bluish light, that tends to flicker pinkly as the energy of the vial is depleted. A common street-lamp can be powered for well over a week by a single vial of miasma.

Although useful, miasma is also highly volatile and reacts explosively to sudden changes in temperature and pressure as well as impacts. The vials in which miasma is stored usually protect against the smallest shocks. Dropping such a vial from head-height may not lead to an explosion, but any impact greater will probably cause the miasma to detonate.

Most of the available miasma is won directly from the marshes in the [[Hèrlmersc]] in [[Lethania]] and the [[Myrk]] in [[Arcadia]], though some deposits have also been found on several of the islands in the Shimmering Straits as well as swampy areas in [[Nachýr]]. Rumours are told that deposits of "solid miasma" have also been found deep beneath the mountains of [[Dvårgheim]].

The [[LoeterCo]] compony has a majority stake in nearly all miasma delving enterprises in the [[Crucible]].

# Properties
At room temperature, and under typical atmospheric pressure, Miasma has a density of 19.11 g/l, which is an order of magnitude denser than that or air, and significantly heavier than any other known gas. 

A standard 50 Bml vial of miasma contains 8.923MJ = 2.479 kWh of energy. This is roughly equal to 2kg of TNT. When correctly applied, one standard 50Bml vial of miasma can bring up to 25 Bl of water from room-temperature to boiling-temperature within a minute. For larger [[Electricity|electric appliances]], larger commercial tanks sizes are available.

One standard 50 Bml vial of miasma contains 0.646g of Miasma, kept under a pressure of 685.5 mbar. 

Miasma has an energy density of 13.80 MJ/g. This corresponds to an energy density of 263.8 MJ/l at standard room temperature and atmospheric pressure, or 178.5 MJ/l at vial-pressure. 
 
When depleted, miasma takes on the form of a light, inert dust. Depleted miasma is strongly hydro- and lipophobic, but highly soluble in [[Quicksilver]]. When properly aerosolized and brought into contact with active miasma, an [[Alchemy|Alchemical]] reaction occurs, known as the [[Holtzmann-Effect]]. This reaction rapidly depletes the surrounding miasma, but efficiently releases a large amount of electricity. 

In addition to its volatility, miasma has many poorly understood psychoactive properties. Breathing in the miasma may lead to mood-swings, paranoia and ultimately madness. The longer the exposure, the more violent and permanent the symptoms. It has also found [[Magic|Magical]] applications, and the application of miasma powered engines to [[Hermetic Philosophy]] is currently being studied at the [[College of Elbisborg]].

# Critical Conditions
The critical pressure, above which miasma will spontaneously, and violently, discharge, depends on the temperature according to:
$$ P_c(T) = P_a \left[ \left(\frac{T}{T_a}\right) \exp\left(\frac{T_a}{T} - 1\right) \right]^{3/4}.$$
The activation pressure and temperatures for miasma have been observed to be $P_a = 1005.06(76)$ mbar  and $T_a =182.386(97)$°C respectively.

From this, it follows that at standard room temperature, Miasma can detonate when exposed to pressures in excess of 1094 mBar. At standard pressure, miasma has a critical temperature of 121.48°C. This corresponds to an activation energy of 

Under closed storage conditions (685.5 mbar at room temperature), the critical temperature lies around 160°C, at which point the pressure in the container will be approximately 1 bar. Local pressure waves in excess of 400 mbar are required to detonate miasma under storage conditions. 

If miasma were to be stored in a closed container under atmospheric pressure, then a temperature of 40 degrees, can be enough to bring miasma to its critical state, illustrating why under-pressure is typically used for storage containers.
