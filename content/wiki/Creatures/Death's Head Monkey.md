# Death's Head Monkey
While originally native to the South-Western jungles of [[Nachýr]], these monkeys can nowadays be commonly found in [[Tel Varesh]] and other large urban areas. They are commonly kept as pets, used as messengers, and can be found in stray packs living in abandoned attics and alleys.

Occasionally [[Thaumaturgy|Thaumaturges]] may bind [[Angel|empyreal spirits]] to these monkeys to create highly intelligent winged servitors.
