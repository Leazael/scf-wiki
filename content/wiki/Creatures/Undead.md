Undead are beings in that are deceased but behave as if alive. Undead can be both corporeal, in the case of [[Ghoul|Ghouls]] and [[Vampire|Vampires]]; or incorporeal, in the case of ghosts and wraiths.

Undead can be largely split into two categories: the *crafted* undead and the *emergent* undead. 

Undead are exceedingly rare in [[Crucible]], though they are with some popularity fictionalised in [[Kinescope]]-stories, or as adversaries of [[Sophist|Sophists]]. Some have speculated that this is because the rituals of the [[Church of Iomedae|Church]] have effectively banished these unholy influences, and that they may return if the world falls into [[Alatrism|Alatry]].

# Crafted Undead
Crafted undead are those created through a conscious [[Necromancy|necromatic]]  act of a [[Magic|magic-user]], such as the guardians of the [[Vareshian Commonwealth|Vareshian]] ossuaries, and quite possibly [[Koschei the Deathless]]. 

The [[Thaumaturgy|Thaumaturges]] and [[Masked Priests]] of [[Tel Varesh]] are known to raised the dead in this manner, to protect the tombs and ossuaries from [[Ghoul|Ghouls]] and other unwanted intruders. 

Supposedly, the [[Mur√¶nes]] used humanoid undead as their agents during the [[Massacre of Eldmere]].

# Emergent Undead
Emergent undead are those that are formed due to external circumstances, as is most often the case with [[Ghost|ghosts]] and [[Ghost|wraiths]]. [[Ghoul|Ghouls]] and [[Vampire|Vampires]] and other undead that "propagate" are often counted among the latter as well.
