Blood Moths are a common pest, native to [[Tel Varesh]] and the [[Vareshian Commonwealth]]. 

They are known to bite [[Ork|Orks]], [[Human|Humans]] and other sapient species for their blood. Only [[Halfling|Halflings]] are known to eschewed by the blood sucking insects. 

Blood Moths can vary wildly in size, depending on their age, with the younger ones being no larger than a finger nail, and old brood-moths to have wing spans up to 8 cm.

Blood Moths generally hunt at night, and once they have latched on to a victim, can be hard to remove. While their bite does not hurt, the small puncture wound caused by their proboscis can take days to properly heal, leaving the victim bleeding. As Blood Moths are strongly attracted to the smell of blood, such victims can become overwhelmed by subsequent bites.

The larger brood moths procreate by planting eggs inside their victims as they are feeding. When the dozens caterpillars hatch, they burrow themselves out of the victims flesh, leaving nasty looking pock-like scars in their wake.
