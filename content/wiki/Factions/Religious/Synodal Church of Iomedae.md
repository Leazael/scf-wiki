The [[Synodal Church of Iomedae]] is a branch of the [[Church of Iomedae]]. It is centred around buildings called churches, one of which can be found in most villages. These are each run by a priest, often called a pastor, who is responsible for the community or parish. If the parish is especially big, this priest is sometimes aided by other priests, called chaplains. Small parishes are often part of a deaconate, led by a dean. These deaconates and parishes together are part of a diocese, run by a bishop. At the head of each country stands an archbishop, who is often also the bishop of the diocese that contains the capital city. All the [[Bishop|Bishops]] and [[Bishop|Archbishops]] of the [[Crucible]] are part of a joint council called the [[Synod]], which determines doctrine and elects new [[Bishop|Bishops]].

[[Arcadia]], being the founding country of the Church of Iomedae, plays a special role in its hierarchical system. First of all, the [[Mary VIII|Queen of Arcadia]] is both the [[Bishop|Archbishop]] of [[Covenant]], and the formal leader of the [[Synod]], which has its seat in the city of [[Covenant]]. Since many [[Bishop|Bishops]] rarely leave their diocese, they are often represented at the council by priests called [[Os|Ora]] (singular: [[Os]]). Secondly, the Queen is also the supreme commander of the Army [[Holy Order of Paladins]] an institution that split off from the [[Arcadia|Arcadian]] army during the [[White Revolution]]. The [[Holy Order of Paladins]] has many chapters all throughout the [[Crucible]].

A small of powerful part of the Church is known as the [[Inquisition]]. The main aim of this Inquisition is the Vanquishing of the Enemies of the Faith. Historically, they were the branch of the church responsible for the eradication of the worship of [[Tiamat]] from the enlightened lands. Nowadays, they often crop up in regions where people are commonly accused of Dark [[Magic]]". What [[Magic]] is exactly considered dark, and who practises it is often highly subjective and decided by locally established tribunals.

The [[Synodal Church of Iomedae]] themselves can be split into two distinct branches;
- The [[Orthodox Synodal Church of Iomedae]], which governs [[Arcadia]] and most of [[Polovina]].
- The [[Sosulkan Churches of Iomedae]]  which governs [[Las]], [[Izmoroz]] and the [[Sosulkan]] parts of [[Polovina]]. They split from the [[Orthodox Synodal Church of Iomedae]] after the [[White Revolution]], in an event called the [[Secession of '37]], but rejoined [[Synod]] during the [[Reparation of '51]], after the death of [[Koschei the Deathless]] and his succession by [[Ivan I Czarovitch]].

Following the events of the [[Thanatogenic Ghost Storm]] in 1762, the [[Synod]] has incorporated the [[Dimmerschlu√ü Creed]] into its official doctrine.

In the wake of the [[Revelationary Revolution|Apocalyptic Revolution]], several churches have formally distanced themselves from  the [[Synod]], forming the several [[Asynodal Churches of Iomedae]].
