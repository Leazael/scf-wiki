The Holy Order of St. Omelas, is a holy order of the [[Orthodox Synodal Church of Iomedae]] seated in [[Covenant]]. It is named after [[St. Omelas]], an otherwise lesser [[Saint]].

The Holy Order of St. Omelas effectively functions as a supernatural intelligence agency for the [[Synodal Church of Iomedae|Synodal Church]]. How the order actually gains its intelligence remains one of the best kept secrets of the [[Synodal Church of Iomedae|Church]], though it is said that the order has access to certain prophecies that pertain to the fate of the [[Church of Iomedae|Church]] and [[Arcadia]].

The Order occasionally interacts with the [[Holy Order of St. Alia]], mainly by delivering, seemingly from nothing, highly useful information related to corruption, crime or [[Heresy]] within the [[Synodal Church of Iomedae|Church]].

Supposedly, it was on their orders that a large part of [[Ilm's Watch]] was evacuated, before it was sacked by [[Tiamat]] in [[1018 AF]]. Furthermore, the invasion of [[VÃ¡ida Khan]] ([[1585 AF]]) was also predicted and the order even played a part in the decision to divert [[Averion]] from [[Arcadia]].

The Order of St. Omelas does not have a strict hierarchy, though it is formally lead by the Abbot.
