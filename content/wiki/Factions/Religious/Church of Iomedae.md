The Church of [[Iomedae]] is without doubt the most far spread and influential of the [[Crucible|Crucible’s]] religions. According to tradition, the Goddess [[Iomedae]] was originally a mortal (often assumed [[Human]]) shieldmaiden who came into power and eventually godhood during the [[Rupture of the Æther]] over 2000 years ago. 

The faith was introduced to the [[Crucible]] by the first [[Arcadia|Arcadian]] settlers 1200 years ago and has since spread to nearly every nation of the [[Crucible]], displacing the worship of the [[Old Sosulkan Gods]] and the [[Æsir]]. For the last 800 years, the Church of [[Iomedae]] is the foremost religion in [[Ilmbund]], [[Lethania]], [[Arcadia]], [[Las]] and [[Izmoroz]], though it can also be found in [[Dvårgheim]] and in [[Nachýr]].

The church originated in [[Arcadia]] in, brought along with its settlers in [[526 AF]]. At the start of the 11th century, they had displaced the [[Old Sosulkan Gods]] in most parts of the [[Crucible]].

The religion is based on four principle texts, the [[Three Lays]], The [[Six Tenets]], The [[Nine Parables]] and the [[Book of Canon Law]], that are collectively refered to as the [[Iomedaean Canon]].

# Beliefs
The Church and its worshippers actively worship only a single deity: [[Iomedae]]. The Church promises it followers one simple thing: that good will eventually come to those that deserve it, be it in this life or thereafter. As such, worshippers generally believe that they will be personally judged by [[Iomedae]] after death. Good individuals are promised entry to Heaven, while those who have sinned too much are promised an eternity of hellfire.

There are parts of the Church that believe that [[Magic]] not granted by the goddess is inherently sinful and evil, a belief that is particularly strong in many [[Asynodal Churches of Iomedae]].

In communities that adhere to this belief, any witches, sorcerers and wizards, but also druids and sometimes even bards are hunted down, tried and burned. Even the parts of the church that are accepting of other spellcasters uniformly condemn the use of most [[Necromancy]], charm effects, compulsion effects and the [[Transliminal magic|summoning]] of non-good outsiders (including [[Elemental Spirit|elementals]]). 

The countries of [[Arcadia]] and [[Polovina]] have encompassed basically all tenets and rules from the Church into their laws.

The Church of [[Iomedae]] was founded on the idea that the gods, by their nature, are either uncaring or evil. Otherwise, why would they treat the world as they did during the [[Rupture of the Æther]]? Hence the worship of other gods, depending on the deity, is by the faithful often seen as either foolish, or outright evil.  

Many worshippers of [[Iomedae]] believe that these heathens, after their death, will be doomed to wander around in a place called Purgatory, waiting to be judged by their gods. Furthermore, it is believed that the souls of particularly evil heretics will be snatched from that place by the many roaming devils, demons and daemons, and be dragged to their rightful place into one of the Hells.   

Some members of the Inquisition take this one step further and preach that the only way to make sure that these evil heretics do not evade the devils of purgatory, is by making sure they convert to the church of [[Iomedae]] before their death. This conversion is usually forced on the unbeliever by any means necessary.  

Despite these beliefs, the church tolerates the worship or recognition of any non-evil deity, as long as people abide by the [[Six Tenets|Fifth Tenet]].

# Structure
The church is effectively split into two separate branches, the [[Synodal Church of Iomedae]] and the [[Asynodal Churches of Iomedae]]. The former can be further split into the [[Orthodox Synodal Church of Iomedae]] and the [[Sosulkan Churches of Iomedae]].

Regarding the [[Asynodal Churches of Iomedae]], churches that did not maintain formal contact with the [[Synod]] have always existed, but it was not until the events leading up to the [[Revelationary Revolution]] that these number became significant.

The [[Synodal Church of Iomedae]] and many [[Asynodal Churches of Iomedae]] do agree on the doctrine, if not the structure of the church. This doctrine is summarized in the [[Dimmerschluß Creed]].

There exist many [[Asynodal Churches of Iomedae]] who do not abide by the creed and may even adopt some [[Heresy|heresies]], such as 
	- [[Perfectionist Iomedaeism]]
	- [[Symbolic Iomedaeism]]
	- [[Protokyriatic Deism]]

# Practice
Practice varies between the [[Orthodox Synodal Church of Iomedae]], the [[Sosulkan Churches of Iomedae]] and the [[Asynodal Churches of Iomedae]], but still all have much in common.

Most people worship by praying several times per day, most often before meals and before going to sleep. Besides this, Sun's Eve is generally considered a resting day. Most craftsman and other professionals take this day off and use it to visit the mass at the local church.  

At the end of a sermon, it is customary to wash one's hands in holy-water, thus symbolically washing away the remainders of previously committed sins. Whenever a new child is born, the child is traditionally washed or baptised in holy-water. This ritual ensures the safety of the child's soul until it is old enough to take part in mass.

# Symbols
The main symbols of the Church are the Sheathed Sword and the [[Star of Iomedae]] (a unicursal hexagram). It is not uncommon to see these two symbols incorporated into everyday jewellery. Among the militant and the more fundamentalist branches of the church the burning torch is also used as a symbol of the faith.

Members of [[Asynodal Churches of Iomedae]], especially those not abiding by the [[Dimmerschluß Creed]] may wear the [[Star of Iomedae]] sideways.

# Events
There are four religious events per year, namely at the winter solstice, the spring equinox, the summer solstice and the autumn equinox.  

The first of these, called Shade's Night, is celebrated on the longest night. People stay inside with their families, exchange presents and decorate the windows with special curtains. During the day there is a short mass, in which people pray for the lengthening of days.

The second, called the Walpurgis Night, is a large celebration, usually with the entire community, in which the last of the winter-hogs are butchered and bonfires are lit.

The third is Midyear which falls on the longest day. On this day, people celebrate the birth and apotheosis of Iomedae. Both events supposedly occurred during the summer solstice.

The fourth and final is All Hallows' Eve. On this day people give thanks for the harvest and remember all those who have died in the past year, as well as the dead in general. A large central festival is usually held, where people where gaudy clothing and dance. It is considered good luck to wear an heirloom throughout the day.

# Texts
The Church of Iomedae endorses four main literary works: the [[Three Lays]], the [[Six Tenets]], the [[Nine Parables]] and the [[Book of Canon Law]]. Together, these works are known as The [[Iomedaean Canon]]. 

The oldest (roughly 1800 years old) known versions of [[Iomedaean Canon|The Canon]] hail from [[Vahestan]] and was written in the [[Celestial]] Tongue. Modern versions are more commonly available in [[Anglic]], but [[Synod|sanctioned]] and [[Asynodal Churches of Iomedae|unsanctioned]] translations can be found in both [[Ildarin]], [[Sosulkan]] and even [[Dvårgish]]. Since the invention of the printing press and movable type, the Canon has become one of the most printed books in the [[Crucible]].
