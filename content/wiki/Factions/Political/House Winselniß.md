_Motto: Mater Artium Necessitas. Blazon: Sable, three dragonflies volent-en-arriere Or, on a chevron Argent as many gears Gules._

One of the [[Great Joust|Great Houses]] of [[Lethania]] before the [[Lethanian War of Separation]]. They used to be the ruling family of [[Yrsingen]] and ruled from the city of [[Weißenfels]].

House Winselniß has retreated into relative obscurity after the [[Lethanian War of Separation]]. However, they are still involved in running the [[Academy of Weißenfels]] and are notable [[Natural Philosophy|natural philosophers]]. They have made a small fortune by owning many of the [[Mythril]] mines in the [[Myriad Mountains]].

The house used to breed and keep large dragonflies, however in recent generations these have been replaced with mechanical anisopters instead.

Notable members:
- Albrecht Winselniß, who reformed the family in the early 18th century and started it on its progressice, [[Natural Philosophy]] inclined track.
- Lys Winselniß, who finished Albrecht's work
