The Three Great Guilds of [[Ilmbund]] comprise one of the two governing bodies of the modern state of [[Ilmbund]], with the other being the parliament. The guildmasters of the three Guilds, also known as the [[Triumvirate of Ilmbund|Triumvirate]] are the formal heads of the state of [[Ilmbund]]. 

The Great Guilds currently consist of [[Guild of Alchemists]], the [[Guild of Clockworkers]] and the [[Guild of Bankers and Brokers]], each rules from their respective chapterhouse in [[SÃ¤len]].

The Great Guilds were founded in [[1455 AF]], after the Royal House of [[Ilmbund|Ilm]] was displaced in the aftermath of the third [[Crusade]] ([[1416 AF]] to [[1424 AF]]). The original [[Triumvirate of Ilmbund|Triumvirate]] was made up from  the Guild of Blacksmiths, the Guild of Carpenters and the [[Guild of Stonemasons]].  

In the early [[1704 AF]] the Guild of Blacksmiths was replaced by the [[Guild of Alchemists]], and in [[1711 AF]], a new upheaval takes place when the [[Guild of Clockworkers]] similarly replaces the Guild of Carpenters.

In the wake of the [[Revelationary Revolution|Apocalyptic Revolution]], and in particular the [[Twelve-Day War]] of [[1730 AF]], the [[Guild of Stonemasons]] was outlawed and replaced by the [[Guild of Bankers and Brokers]].
