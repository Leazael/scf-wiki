A hermetic lodge is a social club, often, though not exclusively, high-society, that is dedicated to the amateur study of [[Hermetic Philosophy]]. 

Most, though not all, these lodges are connected to the [[College of Elbisborg]], usually through alumni, donorship and publications.

Membership of a lodge is often requires a previous, though not necessarily formal, study of [[Natural Philosophy]], or sometimes even membership of a particular [[Church of Iomedae|Church]].
