Elves, sometimes called High Elves, are a tall (taller than most [[Human|Humans]]) slender race known for their grace, their pointed ears and their large almond-shaped eyes. The High elves are one of the three known elven races, with the other two being the [[Grey Elf|Grey Elves]] and the [[Half-Elf|Half-Elves]] respectively. 

High Elves generally adopt the same colour schemes as their surroundings and an elf's colours may change drastically over the course of centuries. Elves that dwell in the forest often have tanned skins and brown or green eyes, while mountain dwelling elves are usually pale with grey eyes.

Since time immemorial, the High Elves and the [[Grey Elf|Grey Elves]] have been enemies, according to both parties, "since the beginning of time". However, the two elven races reconciled in the events following the [[Elven Genocide]].

Since the [[Elven Genocide]] in [[1564 AF]], most elves have migrated to the [[Grey Elf|Grey Elven]] home-[[Planet]] [[Elsar]]. Ever since, elves have been extremely rare in the [[Crucible]], though wandering individuals or recluses can sometimes be found.

Elves, amongst themselves, speak their own language, [[Elven]].

*The elves of SCF are mostly inspired by Sindar elves of Middle-Earth. With the Grey Elves particularly inspired by the Noldor.*

# Life
Elves are an exceedingly ling lived race, where individuals rarely fail to live for more than 1000 years. Unless from accident, disease or murder, elves do not actually die. Instead they Fade into their surroundings, blending into the landscape into a form of hibernation. It is theorized that an Elf can avoid this fate by changing their surroundings often enough, however at their age, they rarely bother.

# Demographics
Elves make up a negligible percentage of the population of the [[Crucible]]. Most elves will be mistaken for [[Half-Elf|Half-Elves]] by the majority of the population, as [[Half-Elf|Half-Elves]] are a hundredfold more common. Most elves have migrated to the [[Crucible]] back when the gates of the [[Shining Academy]] were still open. Supposedly, A small community of elves can still be found in the mountain kingdom om [[Dalriada]].

# Professions 
Urban Elves are renowned for their Artistry, though they can be found in any profession.

# Religion
Elves usually respect the local religions, but rarely actively participate. Nearly all elves pay at least a passing homage to [[Correllon]].
