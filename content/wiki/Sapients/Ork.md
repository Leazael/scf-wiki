aliases: [Orks, Orkish, Orken]

Orks are usually of an equal height with [[Human|Humans]], with powerful builds and greenish, greyish or olive skin. Their lower canine teeth often grow long enough to protrude from their mouths, and these “tusks,” combined with heavy brows and slightly pointed ears, give them their notoriously bestial appearance.  

Though the Orks of the [[Crucible]] often preferred to be called [[Half-Ork|Half-Orks]], emphasizing their a [[Human]] lineage, similar to [[Half-Elf|Half-Elves]], this is not actually the case. Apart from cultural and societal norms, there is no biological difference between the [[Half-Ork|Half-Orks]] and the more "primitive" Orks from [[Las]] and [[Izmoroz]]. Still, many [[Half-Ork|Half-Orks]] from the [[Crucible]] prefer the term, as it connotes with civilization and refinement. In contrast, the Orks from the [[Vareshian Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] of [[Tel Varesh]] prefer to be referred to as "Orks", a fact that the people from the [[Crucible]] tend to ignore

### Demographics
Within the [[Crucible]], half-orks make up about 5% of the population, and up to 10% in urban areas, with higher concentrations in [[Izmoroz]], [[Las]] and [[Polovina]]. They make up about 70% of the population of [[Tel Varesh]].
