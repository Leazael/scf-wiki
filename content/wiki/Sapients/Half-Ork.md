Half-Orks is a term used for and by the [[Ork|Orks]] of the [[Crucible]] to describe themselves. However, it should be noted that, apart from cultural and societal norms, there is no biological difference between the [[Half-Ork|Half-Orks]] and the more "primitive" Orks from [[Las]] and [[Izmoroz]]. 

The half-orks are known for being a hard working and progressive people, always striving to improve their place in society. While they usually succeed in integrating fully into any society they are part of, half-orks still seek each other out and remember their old traditions. All half-orks consider each other part of their family and denying another half-ork charity is considered a grievous offence. They only occasionally intermarry with other humans. In such unions, the child is almost always indistinguishable from a half-ork.

The half-orks of the [[Crucible]] have their own common tongue, often referred to as [[Orkish]].

### Profession
Their loyalty to their family and familiarity with others of their kind has caused many banks, moneylenders and merchant guilds to be either half-ork-owned or half-ork-run. Especially the [[Ilmbund|Ilmian]] [[Guild of Bankers and Brokers]] has a sizable half-orkish minority amongst its members.

### Religion
While they usually conform to the dominant religion of the region they live in, they also practice a form of [[Veneration of the Dead]]. Once every week family comes together to break bread and remember the stories, trials and accomplishments of their [[Veneration of the Dead|Ancestors]].
