Halflings rise to a humble height of 3 feet, and, from a distance, look in many ways like [[Human|Humans]]. However, from up close, their appearance may be fierce. Their hands and feet are, proportionally, slightly larger than a [[Human|Human's]], and when untrimmed, often bear long claw-like nails, with their nails possessing a subunguis, unlike other races. Their teeth are notably more pointed than than of a [[Human]], with relatively small, pointed incisors, sharp canines and possessing carnassials (shearing teeth). 

While it is true that [[Halfling]] have, proportionally, slightly larger feet, and some halfling cultures do traditionally go bare-foot, it is a myth that their feet are naturally more calloused of hardier than that of other species. Since their claw-like nails can give them a "wild" appearance, many settled Halflings in fact prefer to wear shoes.

Halflings of [[Yádor|Yádorian]] descent have skin that tends toward a rich cinnamon colour and their hair toward light shades of brown. In contrast, halflings from [[Voyvetera]] often have pale, pallid, sometimes slightly blueish-appearing skins, and tend towards black or dark grey hair.

A halfling's ears are pointed, but proportionately not much larger than those of a human. 

Halflings are closely related to (and may in fact be the same species as) [[Goblin|Goblins]]. In fact, in [[Tel Varesh]], halflings are often referred to as Hobgoblins. When suffering from malnourishment, their skins tend to take on a sickly green colour, making them all but indistinguishable from their [[Goblin]] cousins.

### Life
Since nearly all Halflings in the [[Crucible]] are descendant from the [[Yádor|Yádorian]] nomads, many halflings tend to travel often and far, taking their dinosaur-pulled carnaval/caravans with them. Throughout a halfling's life, it is not uncommon to settle for several years in a large city, sometimes within a pre-existing and ever-shifting halfling community, only to move out again after a decade or so. Many halflings enjoy urban life, but for many their wanderlust is too deeply anchored to be ignored for ever.

### Demographics
Halflings make up about 5% of the population of the [[Crucible]], with substantially less in urban areas. [[Yádor]] consists for about 30% of halflings. In the northwest of [[Izmoroz]], halflings of [[Voyvetera|Voyveteran]] descend can make up as much as 10% of urban populations. Halflings, or Hobgoblins of [[Voyvetera|Voyveteran]] descent can be found in [[Tel Varesh]], where they make up around 5% of the population.

### Religion
Like most other races, halflings in the [[Crucible]] worship of [[Iomedae]], though often with their own distinct flair of gospel-like worship. In fact, these traveling halfling [[Church of Iomedae|churches]] were among the first [[Asynodal Churches of Iomedae|Asynodal Churches]] in the [[Crucible]].
