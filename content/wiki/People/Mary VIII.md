Her Majesty Queen Mary VIII, by the Grace of the [[Iomedae|Goddess]] and Arcadia, Queen of the [[Arcadia|Realm]], Heir of [[St. Uther|Uther]] and Defender of the [[Church of Iomedae|Faith]] is the current Priest-Queen of [[Arcadia]], the [[Bishop]] of [[Covenant]], the chairman of the [[Synod]] and the formal head of the [[Synodal Church of Iomedae]].

The middle of three children, the other being George and Elizabeth, she took the throne in [[1737 AF]] after the death of her father, [[James IV]]. Upon taking the throne, she immediately instituted many pro-[[Revelationary Revolution|Apocalyptic]] reforms, leading to further democratisation, and reducing her own role in the government. This set of reforms has become collectively known as the [[White Revolution]].

As with all the Priest-Kings of [[Arcadia]], the [[Angel|Archangel]] RemiÃ«l supposedly guides, and facilitates her miracles on behalf of [[Iomedae]].
