Saint Omelas is a lesser [[Saint]] of the [[Synodal Church of Iomedae|Synodal Church]]. It is said that during the first [[Crusade]], they rescued a [[Nachýr|Nachýrian]] slave ship filled with children, and singlehandedly steered it to [[Sallysport]].

Even though the ship had run out of food and fresh water, Saint Omelas was able to stave off starvation by guiding the children in hymns to [[Iomedae]]. The arrival of the Singing Ship of Saint Omelas is still story remembered in [[Sallysport]].
