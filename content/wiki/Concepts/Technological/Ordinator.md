aliases: [Ordinators, Ordination]

An Ordinator is complicated clockwork device, capable of arbitrary acts of computation, modifying its meta-clockwork through the use of punch-cards. People who write these instructions, often for a living, are referred to as meta-clockworkers, or [[Meta|Metas]].

Ordinators were originally invented run arbitrarily complex [[Natural Philosophy|Philosophical]] computations, but have since been adopted by businesses and governments as invaluable aids in storing and processing large quantities of data.

Small modern Ordinators are usually not much larger than a sewing machine, and may include a small [[Miasma]] generator to supply the power needed to operate the internal gearwork. 

Some modern Ordinators use [[Electricity|Electrical]] components in conjunction with its more central clockwork components. While such Ordinators can be faster than regular purely mechanical Ordinators, they require more maintenance. Additionally, sufficiently complex [[Electricity|Electrical]] components tend to attract [[Gremlin|Gremlins]].

A [[Black Box]] is a particular type of Ordinator, designed to perform automatous functions.

# Storage
Data, for reading and long term storage purposes, is most often stored on card-board punch cards. However, more advanced ordination systems have started using high-density storage in shellac.

In [[Ilmbund]], personal identity cards are issued on a shellac card that can be read out, making them incredibly hard to forge.

This process essentially create a shellac microfiche, capable of storing up to 500 normal punch cards in the same area. For readout, light is projected through the fiche onto an array of [[Alchemy|Alchemical]] photo-sensitive filaments, that contract under light exposure, and thus creating the mechanical action needed for readout.
