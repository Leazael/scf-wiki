The Vocofax or Vox, short for "Vocal [[Facsimile Machine|Facsimile]]", is a device that is capable of two-way sonic communication. While Voxes can be made more compactly than a normal [[Facsimile Machine|Facsimile]], the fact remains that creating isomorphic [[Resolite|Resolites]] is an expensive affair. As such, most Vox channel are essentially public, with the [[Resolite|Resolite]] frequencies being produced in batches of hundreds. Hence the same frequencies are  used by often hundreds of people. 

Vox [[Resolite|Resolites]] need to be replaced every month or two, hence maintaining a Vocofax is a costly affair. As such, fully private Vox communication is usually reserved for the very rich. 

However, in resent years, and thanks to the discovery of the much cheaper and stable monodal [[Resolite|Resolites]], private Voxes using two one-way [[Resolite|Resolites]] have become increasingly common. This has also lead to the development of a one-way Vox based entertainment system known as the [[Sonofax]].
