Sophists, or sometimes 'Sopher Heroes (short for [[Natural Philosophy|Philosopher]] Heroes), are often fictitious pop culture figures who use the power of [[Natural Philosophy]] to fight crime and injustice. They are particularly popular in [[Ilmbund]] and [[Lethania]].

In [[Kinescope]]-stories, they are often shown fighting [[Bondsmage|Bondsmages]], [[Serpentfolk]], agents from the [[Holy Order of St. Alia|Order of St. Alia]], evil cabals of [[Hitcher|Hitchers]] and [[Meta|Metas]], and the corrupt [[Ilmbund|Ilmian]] [[Miliz]].
