Wild magic, sometimes called witchcraft, or euphemistically, Pastoral Magic, is an umbrella term given to magical practices that fall outside of the scope of usual religious (through either the [[Church of Iomedae|Church]] [[Ã†sir|or]] [[Old Sosulkan Gods|other]] [[Tiamat|pantheons]]), formal [[Hermetic Philosophy|academic study]] or other more "sophisticated" [[Ways and Means|magical traditions]].

The term "wild magic" is most often applied to magical traditions that have a rural origin, such as the [[Magic|magic]] practiced by herbalists, fortune tellers, and hermits. Sometimes its practicioners are called "witches", primarily by those who, for [[Church of Iomedae|religious]] or [[Revelationary Revolution|apocalyptic]] reasons, object to these practices.

[[Hermetic Philosophy|Hermetic Philosophers]] often divide Wild Magic into two sets of traditions. The more common one, sometimes referred to as "Tame Magic", is often defined as comprising a corpus of cures, remedies and other small blessings that are often used to aid, often rural, communities. The other, more enigmatic set of traditions, sometimes called the "True Wild Magic", or "Willed Magic" refers to more illusive spells that deal with natural forces and is often associated with the [[Fair Folk|People of the Mounds]].
