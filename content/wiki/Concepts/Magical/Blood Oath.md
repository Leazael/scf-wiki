The Blood Oath or the Sanguine Promise is a policy issued in [[699 AR]] by the [[Bondsmage|Bondsmagi]] of the [[Shining Academy]].

The oath states that if an outsider is responsible for the death of a [[Magus]], they will be punished in equal measure. It is the responsibility of all [[Magus|Magi]], but especially the [[Bondsmage|Bondsmagi]], to make this happen.

The original [[Elven Genocide]] started when the ruler off [[Cinis|EledeÃ«l]] declared war on the [[Shining Academy]], rather than submit himself to the justice of the oath.
