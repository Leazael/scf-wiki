Anætherial harmonic resonance is a name for the phenomenon by which the [[Resolite|Resolites]] of [[Facsimile Machine|Facsimile Machines]] interact with each other.

When a [[Miasma]]-[[Holtzmann-Effect|induced]] [[Electricity|current]] is applied to a single [[Resolite]], it causes certain modal harmonies in the [[Resolite]]. Instantaneously, these modal harmonies can be also observed in any sufficiently isomorphic [[Resolite]]. 

The resonance itself is a mostly ununderstood phenomenon, however it has been shown that when decomposed into its principle components, the main modes of any harmony produced in the both the [[Resolite]] and its [[Resolite|Isomorphs]] are in fact orthogonal to the fibrational phase-spaces that make up the [[Luminiferous Æther]].

By exploiting this mechanism, messages, both [[Facsimile Machine|mechanical]] and [[Vocofax|tonal]] can be transmitted, without the usual limitations imposed by the [[Luminiferous Æther]].
