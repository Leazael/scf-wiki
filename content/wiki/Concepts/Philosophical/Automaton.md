aliases: [Automatons, Automata]

Automotons, sometimes pluralized as automata, are machines capable of sapience, and in some cases even sentience. Such machines have a long and arcane history, though many can trace their origins back to the [[Guild of Clockworkers]].

Generally, they can be categorised in two classes: [[Hermetic Philosophy|Hermetic]] and [[Catastrophe Theory|Catastrophic]] automatons.

# [[Hermetic Philosophy|Hermetic]] Automatons
[[Hermetic Philosophy|Hermetic]] Automatons are machines [[Magic|magically]] endowed with an incorporeal [[Elemental Spirit]] that governs the finer functions of the machine. The [[Elemental Spirit|spirit]] bound to the machine parses all inputs and makes all decisions governing the automatons actions. Sufficiently powerful [[Elemental Spirit|spirits]] may even be used as a source of power to operate the machine.

The intelligence and power of such automatons are closely tied with the power of the [[Elemental Spirit]]. If the [[Elemental Spirit|spirit]] is to weak, it may not be very intelligent and may lack processing powers. If the [[Elemental Spirit|spirit]] is too powerful, it may resent being bound and attempt to break free. If the [[Elemental Spirit|spirit]] is capable of incorporating, it may even be able to destroy the machine from the inside.

The [[Ways and Means]] of [[Transliminal magic|summoning]] such [[Elemental Spirit|spirits]] originates with the [[Alchemy|Alchemists]] of the [[Guild of Alchemists|Great Guild]].

# [[Catastrophe Theory|Catastrophic]] Automatons
[[Catastrophe Theory|Catastrophic]] Automatons are those governed by [[Black Box|Black Boxes]], which themselves are one of the few examples of applied [[Catastrophe Theory]]. 

The intelligence of a [[Catastrophe Theory|catastrophic]] automaton, relies largely on the complexity of its [[Black Box]]. While the reasons are not entirely clear, [[Catastrophe Theory|catastrophic]] automatons are generally perceived as less alien than their [[Magic|Magical]] counterparts, the most sophisticated ones are consistently more capable as well.

# Applications 
[[Hermetic Philosophy|Hermetic]] automatons are generally used to endow engines, power supplies and other feats of engineering with rudimentary decision-making capabilities. For instance, several trains have been constructed possessing an [[Elemental Spirit]] as part of the boiler-architecture, allowing them to finely maintain fuel levels and burn rates.

The more sophisticated [[Catastrophe Theory|catastrophic]] automatons are usually made to serve as assistants, secretaries and amanuenses to [[Natural Philosophy|Philosophers]]. However, as cost of maintainance tends to be high, they are a rare sight outside of the walls of the [[University|Universities]] and [[Great Guilds of Ilmbund|Great Guilds]].

One particularity notable automaton is [[Rotwang the Brassman]], who obtained a doctorate from the [[College of Elbisborg]] in 1755. He was the first [[Automaton]] in the [[Crucible]] to officially obtain a higher education.
