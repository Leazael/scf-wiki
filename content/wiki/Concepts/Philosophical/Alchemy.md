Alchemy is the science of substances and their properties, and how these affect and are affected by the natural world. Alchemy is the oldest of the [[Natural Philosophy|Philosophical]] traditions practiced in the [[Crucible]]. 

While Alchemy has contributed in a myriad way to the daily lives of all those who live in the [[Crucible]], the most influential is, without a doubt, the discovery of how to harness the violent energies contained in [[Miasma]].

Before the advent of [[Hermetic Philosophy]], Alchemy provided sole method by which [[Natural Philosophy|Philosophers]] could access effects that could be described as [[Magic|Magical]].

While alchemy is mostly associated with the [[Chrysopoeia|transsubstantiation]] of various substances into others, it is in actuality the cornerstone of many other [[Natural Philosophy|Philosophical]] and even engineering applications:
- A large part of all [[Electricity]] is produced by alchemical means, known as the [[Holtzmann-Effect]].
- Alchemical processes have allowed for the efficient mass production of [[Mythril]] and [[Kavorinium|Kavor]], crucial materials in all modern [[Aviation]].
- Alchemical alterations to crops, have created cultivars much more resistant to extreme weather conditions.
- The production of alchemical dyes has become a vital ingredient in most modern affordable fashion.
- Alchemical remedies form a cornerstone of modern medicine.
- The adoption of [[FIrearm|firearms]] on a large scale has been largely made possible by the alchemical manufacturing of high-grade steels, and various blackpowders.
- The growth of isomorphic [[Resolite|Resolites]], which have enabled [[Facsimile Machine|Facsimile-communication]].

Many other more theoretical and experimental applications have also been developed through the ages. Some of these largely coincide with the modern study of [[Hermetic Philosophy]]. Others, like alchemy's' applications to zoology, are generally frowned upon. 

# Study 
Alchemy can be studied at all of the great [[University|Universities]] of the [[Crucible]].  and a variant, steeped in [[Thaumaturgy|Thaumaturgical]] tradition is even taught at the [[Exalted School of Tel Varesh]]. 

A large curriculum is also taught at the [[Guild of Alchemists]] in [[Ilmbund]], which is also responsible for licensing all publicly operating alchemists in that state. These licenses are held is such a high regard that alchemists endowed with them, seldom have trouble finding employment in any of the [[Philosophical Powers]].

Much terminology in alchemy derives from [[Lingua Alta]], though [[Celestial]] is also encountered in many of the more ancient texts.

# Methods 
Alchemy is known for the employment of many arcane-looking pieces of glassware, intricately constructed furnaces, large apothecaries of materials and so forth. 

Since time immemorial, Alchemists have also employed various [[Magic|Magical]] [[Ways and Means]] to assist them in the fine manipulation of elements needed for their great works. It was in fact alchemists who [[Transliminal magic|summoned]] the first [[Elemental Spirit|Elemental Spirits]] that powered the earliest clockwork [[Automaton|Automatons]].
