A swivelbomb is a weapon of mass destruction, designed to utilize [[Torque]] to destructive purposes. Throughout history, only two such devices have been been constructed and tested.

Swivelbombs were developed by [[Ilmbund|Ilmian]] [[Natural Philosophy|Philosophers]], at some time in [[1757 AF]] at the height of the [[Silent War]]. Two of these bombs were subsequently tested in [[1758 AF]] on two of the eastern-most uninhabited [[Step-Stone Isles]], after a stealth deployment mission.

Their destructive power far exceeded the calculations of the [[Natural Philosophy|Philosophers]] and the results, reminiscent of the [[Cacotopic Warp]], quickly intimidated both sides of the war into a reluctant truce, as neither wished to actually see these weapons deployed in earnest.

After the [[Silent War|war]] had formally ended, the [[Philosophical Powers]] agreed that their development was a mistake, and research into [[Torque]] and [[Swivelbomb|Swivelbombs]] was subsequently forbidden as part of the [[Gabel Pact]].
