Catastrophe Theory is a branch of [[Natural Philosophy]] that lies on the intersection of [[Ordinator|Ordination]] and mathematics. The theory itself deals with the behaviour of systems as a function of the contained entropy and separability of observable states. 

The theory predicts that any sufficiently unobserved system, of sufficient complexity will start exhibiting emergent self-ordering behaviour. 

Catastrophe theory is used in the manufacturing of [[Black Box|Black Boxes]], a key component of all non-[[Hermetic Philosophy|Hermetic]] [[Automaton|Automatons]].

Some philosophers have speculated that the emergence of [[Gremlin|Gremlins]] can also be adequately predicted using catastrophe theory.
