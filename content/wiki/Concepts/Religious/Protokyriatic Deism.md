(Protokyriatisch Deisme)

A [[Heresy|heresy]] often adhered to by believers in [[Perfectionist Iomedaeism]]. The central tenet is that, since [[Iomedae]] is perfect, it must be true that in the time before [[Iomedae]] the world must have yearned for a facsimile, as nature abhors a vacuum.

This means that in the world before the [[Rupture of the Æther]], the void that anticipated [[Iomedae]] was filled by *protokyriatic deities*. These deities were imperfect, since they only incorporated parts of Iomedae-to-be, but still without flaws, as a flawed being would never be able to mantle [[Iomedae]] in such a way.

Deities hypothesised to be protokyriatic deities include:
- [[Vahamut]] (debated)
- [[Æsir|Týr]]
- St. Cuthbert
- Heironeous
- Pelor
- Ilmater
- Torm
- Yondalla

Some adherents may even belief that the mortal [[Iomedae]] never existed, or that the mortal [[Iomedae]] herself fulfilled a role much similar to these protokyriatic deities, a belief also called [[Symbolic Iomedaeism]].
