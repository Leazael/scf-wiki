# Alatrism
*Alatrism or alatry (Greek: from the privative ἀ- + λατρεία (latreia) = worship) is the recognition of the existence of one or more gods, but with a deliberate lack of worship of any deity. Typically, it includes the belief that religious rituals have no supernatural significance, and that gods ignore all prayers and worship.*

While most people do not deny the existence of deities or higher beings, an increasing trend among the middle and upper classes of the [[Philosophical Powers]] is the idea that these beings do not require or are not worthy of worship. This combination of believe without worship is referred to as Alatry or Alatrism.

The practice (or lack thereof) is particularly common in [[Ilmbund]], with [[Elbisborg]] and [[Sälen]] producing the most alatristic literature. It is also  quite common among the [[Gnome|Gnomes]] of the [[Crucible]] and adherents can be found throughout [[Ilmbund]], [[Arcadia]], [[Lethania]] and [[Polovina]].

Naturally, the [[Church of Iomedae]] is not sympathetic to these trends with some individual churches attempting to actively proselytizing among alatristic communities.
