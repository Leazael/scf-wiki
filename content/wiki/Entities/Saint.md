A Saint is designation for a being who resides with [[Iomedae]] in the Heavens. Most saints were once mortal men, who lived particularly noble lives or died particularly noble deaths. It is believed that the Saints may intercede with [[Iomedae]] directly.

Tradition divides Saints into two or three categories, namely lesser and greater saints. The latter is occasionally further subdivided into the greater or [[Iomedaean Canon|Canonical]] saints and the primordial Saints.

# Greater or [[Iomedaean Canon|Canonical]] Saints
These Saints are those recognized within the [[Iomedaean Canon]]. As such they include the [[Twelve Paladins]]. 

Examples include:
- [[Saint Alia|St. Alia]]

# Lesser Saints
Lesser saints are those who reached acclaim during the existence of the [[Church of Iomedae]] in the [[Crucible]]. Lesser Saints are often, though not exclusively, local figures. Many of them are patron saints of arts, crafts or trades, or even particular institutions.

Examples include:
- [[St. Uther]]
- [[St. Omelas]]

# Primordial Saints
The primordial saints are entities venerated like saints, in the sense that they may intercede directly with [[Iomedae]] herself, but that do not have existences that can be traced back to mortal lives. 

Generally, they Include the four [[Angel|Archangels]]:
- St. [[Angel|MichaÃ«l]]
- St. [[Angel|Sandalphon]]
- St. [[Angel|Remiel]]
- St. [[Angel|Zaphkiel]]
