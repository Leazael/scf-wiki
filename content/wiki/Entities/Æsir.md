The Æsir are a pantheon of [[God|gods]], sometimes also called the Northern [[God|gods]] or the Elder [[God|gods]], and comprise the [[God|gods]] that were traditionally worshipped by the cultures of the [[Crucible]], before the Church of Iomedae started proselytizing. Although they are commonly associated with [[Dvårgheim]] and Dvårgish or [[Dwarf|dwarven]] culture, they are in fact older than that, having their roots in the north-eastern regions of the Previous World.

The Æsir are mainly worshipped in [[Dvårgheim]], the south of [[Thrjoskarland]] and in the [[Fomorian Mountains]]. Some members of the Æsir are sometimes revered alongside, or even identified with some of the [[Old Sosulkan [[God|gods]]]] of [[Izmoroz]].

The [[Calendar|Days of the week]] contain many references to these [[God|gods]]. 

# Beliefs 
Those who worship the Æsir believe that these [[God|gods]] play an important part in the way the world works, with each [[God]] influencing certain aspects of existence. While there exist many tales regarding these [[God|gods]], and even some prophecies, most of are simply taken for their value as stories, instead of literal truth

Some of the most well known deities are Odin, Frigg, Thor, Freya, Loki, Týr, Hel and Freyr. While the religion itself refers to the Æsir, it should be noted that not all these deities are of the Æsir. Freya and Freyr belong in fact to a related group of beings called the Vanir. Nonetheless, they are still worshipped by all those who worship the Æsir.

# Structure
There is no central structure of the Faith itself. While several courts, most notably the court of [[Dvårgheim]], enlist a high-priest that represents all of the [[God|gods]], most priests are either village elders or travellers. Some of these take it upon themselves to represent a specific deity (usually Odin, Thor, Frigg or Hel), bust most simply represent the faith in general.

Priests usually take one or two apprentices during their lives, whom they teach both the mundane and [[Magic|Magical]] aspects of priesthood. At the end of his or her training, an apprentice is supposed to know all the the rituals, and most of the tales, songs and poems that represent the religion.

The responsibilities of these priests include speaking justice at trials, performing marriage, birth and burial ceremonies and preserving the songs, poems and stories of the religion, collectively called the Eddur (singular: Edda).

# Practice
Most larger households have at least a couple of statues of prominent [[God|gods]]. These usually include Odin, Thor and either Frigg or Freya. It is not uncommon to give small offerings at the village shrine. 

# Symbols

There are several prominent symbols associated with the Æsir. Most notably Thor's hammer, Mjǫllnir, is often depicted or worn as a necklace. Other symbols include the Valknut, Odin's Horn, Gungir, Yggdrasil, Sleipnir and Týr's rune.

# Events 
While not specifically religious events, the solstices are usually celebrated by people who worship the Æsir. In addition, local spring and harvest festivals are also organized. At each of these, it is common for priests to participate in the festivities by the telling of tales and the singing of songs from the Eddur.

The most important even is the festival of [[Calendar|Yule]] at midwinter, when oats are re-sworn and sacrifices are performed.

# Texts
The collective set of stories, poems and songs regarding the Æsir and their deeds is often referred to as the Eddur, or the Tales. While there are some written versions in existence, they are most often communicated verbally.
