The Altpox was a disease that ravaged [[Elbisborg]] in the wake of the [[Blightfire of Elbisborg|Blightfire]] of [[1707 AF]]. It is hypothesized that this event was caused by the recklessness of the [[Alchemy|Alchemists]] at the [[College of Elbisborg|College]].

The Altpox was not particularly deadly, with a mortality rating not exceeding 15%, however, those affected by had a tendency to develop curious mutations, such as patches of feathers, extra eyes, or even a tentacle or gills. 

While not communicable, there is some evidence that the effects of the Altpox may be inheritable.
