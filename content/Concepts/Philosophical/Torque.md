Torque is a [[Elementary Philosophical Forces|fundamental]] force or power studied by [[Natural Philosophy|Natural Philosophers]] and occasionally [[Hermetic Philosophy|Hermetic Philosophers]]. While it is generally agreed upon that Torque interacts with [[Magic]], there is still quite some debate on whether it is actually [[Magic|Magical]] in nature, or some other fundamental force altogether. 

It has also been hypothesized, but not proven, that Torque may have been one of the forces responsible for the [[Cacotopic Warp]] of [[Holmgard]] and may even be what the forces that has made [[Ru√Øn]] what it is.

[[Natural Philosophy|Philosophers]] have in the past utilized Torque to create powerful weapons known as [[Swivelbomb|Swivelbombs]] during the conflict known as the [[Silent War]]. However, after the destructive power of these weapons were demonstrated during two half-successful tests (whose outcome has been compared to the [[Cacotopic Warp]]), the [[Philosophical Powers]] agreed that their development was a mistake, and research into Torque and [[Swivelbomb|Swivelbombs]] was subsequently forbidden as part of the [[Gabel Pact]].
