A Black Box is a [[Natural Philosophy|philosophical]] device, build from iterative layers of meta-clockwork. It is essentially a clockwork device of such an intricate and unobservable nature that its state is able to oscillate around the [[Catastrophe Theory|catastrophical limit]].

These boxes are used to endow [[Automaton|Automatons]] with rudimentary, or even advanced, decision making capabilities, functioning essentially as the [[Automaton|Automatonâ€™s]] brain.

A black box ceases to function properly when opened and observed, as this causes internal entropy to dissipate due to the increased observability of the system.

The reliable production of black boxes is a closely held trade secret of the [[Guild of Clockworkers]]. 

Some have speculated that a Black Box is nothing more than a sophisticated means of summoning and trapping a [[Gremlin]].
