Natural Philosophy is a term encompassing a broad range of sciences from [[Alchemy]], medicine and physics, to mathematics and even [[Hermetic Philosophy|magic]].

The advances of natural philosophy have have led to great deal of modernisation in the [[Crucible]], especially in what are often called the [[Philosophical Powers]]. 

# History 
Most scholars agree that Natural History developed out of the ancient science of [[Alchemy]], and was greatly stimulated by the discovery of the various [[Miasma]] applications, allowing Philosophers to harvest the [[Crucible]]'s most power fuel source.

For a detailed breakdown, see [[History of Natural Philosophy]]

# Branches 
Natural Philosophy can be broken down into many different sciences and disciplines. It should be noted that, with the possible exception of the traditional [[Alchemy|Alchemists]], scholars of Natural Philosophy are often pride themselves on their interdisciplinary zeal.

Some notable branches and specialisations include:
- [[Alchemy]], the study of substance and material.
	- [[Chrysopoeia]], or the science transubstantiation. 
	- The study of [[Miasma]].
	- Botany and zoology are traditionally considered a sub-fields of [[Alchemy]] as they often deal with the creation of hybrids or chimeras.
	- Medicine, a relatively new field, also has a strong basis in [[Alchemy|Alchemical]] tradition.
- [[Elementary Philosophical Forces|Illumination]], or the study of light.
	- Cryology and thermology.
- [[Ordinator|Ordination]] devices, both theoretical and applied, such as
	- Study of [[Meta|Meta-Clockwork]] and the writing of [[Ordinator]] programs
	- Study and development of [[Black Box|Black Boxes]].
	- Study [[Automaton|Automatons]] and their psychology.
- Mathematics, in both theory and application.
- [[Catastrophe Theory]], a holistic study of system dynamics and system psychology. (Often but not [[Gremlin|exlcusively]] in the context of [[Ordinator|Ordination]] and [[Black Box|Black Boxes]].)
- [[Anætherial Resonance|Anætherial Harmonic Resonances]], and the study of the behaviour of [[Resolite|Resolites]].
- Astrography, or the study of the motion and compositions of the various [[Planet|Planets and Moons]].
- Geography, Oceanology and aerology.
- [[Hermetic Philosophy]] and [[Transliminal magic|Transliminal Communication]]
- The study of [[Electricity]], the [[Holtzmann-Effect]] and [[Transcalorical Induction]].
- The forbidden (by the [[Gabel Pact]]) study of [[Torque]].
- The study of the [[Elementary Philosophical Forces]].
- The study of [[Wirtship]].
- Industrial and civil engineering.

# Study
The most well known centres for the study Natural philosophy are of course the [[University|Universities]], in particular the [[Academy of Weißenfels]], the [[College of Elbisborg]] and the [[Seminary of Aldsbury]].

Besides this, more practical classes of Natural Philosophy are often taught at the guilds. The [[Great Guilds of Ilmbund|Great Guilds]] especially are known for teaching large classes from their guild halls in [[Sälen]].

Most modern philosophical discourse is done in [[Ildarin]], however most older works on philosophy (and modern [[Alchemy|Alchemical]] treatises) are more often written in [[Lingua Alta]].

# Applications 
The use of [[Miasma]] enables many modern conveniences, from power generation, to steam-locomotives. Due to its high energy density and the existence of large natural reserves, it is probably, after simple wood, the most widely used fuel source in the [[Crucible]]. 

Many upper-middle-class houses have access to [[Electricity]] and other means of power, usually by means of a [[Reichenbach Resonator]], [[Electricity|Commutator]] or regular [[Miasma]] deliveries. (Large [[Electricity]] networks are eschewed due to the likelihood of [[Gremlin]]-infestation.)

This power is mainly used for heating (warm water, central heating, and cooking) or refrigeration, or other modern devices, like a [[Sonofax]] or a [[Vocofax|Vox]].

Natural philosophy has also enabled the creation of new mass media, with the [[Sonofax|Sax]] and the [[Kinescope]] being the most notable examples.

The deployment of [[Ordinator|Ordinators]] by the [[Philosophical Powers|philosophical governments]] has also enabled new levels of bureaucracy. [[Ilmbund]] in particular has managed all citizens to carry a shellac personal identification card complete with micro-diapositives and photomechanical punch-card data.

Natural Philosophy has also enabled the development of a myriad of new weaponry. The most ubiquitous of which would be the many [[FIrearm|firearms]] that circulate the [[Crucible]] since the [[Lethanian War of Separation]]. That war also saw the deployment of many other terrifying weapons, from [[Miasma]]-bombs, to [[Alchemy|Alchemical]] rains. Most terrifyingly, a few philosophers have manage to harness the terribly [[Torque]] in order to create the devastating [[Swivelbomb|Swivelbombs]]. The results of early tests with these were so devastating that further research was immediately banned by [[Gabel Pact|international treaty]].
