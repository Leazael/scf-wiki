An important concept among students of [[Hermetic Philosophy]] is that of the Chapel at the Abyss. The term refers to a legendary location in the [[St. Uther|Pendragonian]] [[Scabbard Cycle]] and represents a point of no return that every [[Hermetic Philosophy|Hermetic Philosopher]] will ultimately reach as part of their studies.

The study of the various [[Dialectic|Dialectics]] in [[Hermetic Philosophy]], the contradictions, and their unifications, lead the philosopher to consider contradictions in the wider world from a different perspective than the uninitiated. The _Chapel_ is a metaphor for the point at which the philosopher internalizes one of two worldviews

- When one sees the world through a [[Hermetic Philosophy|Hermetic]] lens, they come to realize that [[Magic]] is not limited to Hermetic [[Dialectic|Dialectics]] alone. Wherever opposites are united, true [[Magic]] is achieved in the fullest sense of the word. [[Magic]] is thus an integral part not only of nature, but also of society, [[Wirtship]], politics, and so on. [[Alchemy|Alchemical]] reactions are actually spells, as well as the formation of a political coalition between opposing parties.

- The other option is that the Wizard develops a deep form of agnosticism. Not all contradictions in the world lead to magic, so why would Hermetic contradictions lead to magic? Do Hermetic spells actually accomplish anything, or is magic nothing more than a collective mass hallucination? Do gods even exists, or is their manifestation part of the same delusion?

As a result, many [[Hermetic Philosophy|Hermetic Philosophers]] are perceived as eccentric, even by other students of [[Natural Philosophy]].
