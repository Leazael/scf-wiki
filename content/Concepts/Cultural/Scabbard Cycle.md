The Scabbard Cycle is a [[St. Uther|Pendragonian]] work of literary fiction that deals with the search for mythical [[Scabbard of Iomedae]], which she supposedly discarded in the [[Three Lays|Lay of Steel]].

In it, three knights become accursed after exhibiting unnecessary bloodshed on the battlefield. Due to their curse they are forced to live with their sword in their hand. To lift the curse each of them sets out to find the [[Scabbard of Iomedae]].

All three knights encounter the [[Chapel at the Abyss]], where two of the three knights are tempted away from their quest, though the final one resists and succeeds.
