Hermetic philosophy is a branch of [[Natural Philosophy]] that studies the forces and phenomena often referred to as [[Magic]]. Hermetic philosophy was developed in the wake of the [[Revelationary Revolution|Apocalyptic Revolution]] and in particular the [[Warlock's Revolt]].

Most Hermetic Philosophy has been developed at the [[College of Elbisborg]], which boasts the only formal department of Hermetic Philosophy. Nonetheless, informal groups studying Hermetic Philosophy have also formed around the other [[University|Universities]], and some independent [[Hermetic Lodge|Hermetic Lodges]] dedicated to its study have appeared as high-society clubs.

Practitioners and students of Hermetic Philosophy have formed a corpus of research not only detailing the practice and development of hermetic spells, but also providing a framework that can be used to study other mortal magical traditions, such as [[Wild Magic]], the [[Ways and Means]] practiced by craftsmen and artificers, and even [[Tel Varesh|Vareshian]] [[Thaumaturgy]].

# Practice
Hermetic philosophers are known to summon [[Transliminal magic|Extraplanar]] entities in complicated rituals that consume large amounts of Hermetically enriched [[Miasma]], and are often steeped in the trappings of [[Esoteric Iomedaeism]].

The study of Hermetic Philosophy can lead to rather eccentric modes of thought. The formation of these is often metaphorically described as the [[Chapel at the Abyss]]. 

Much of the language used by Hermetic Philosophers is derived from the [[Alchemy|Alchemical]] [[Natural Philosophy|Philosophies]], and despite disavowing any association with the [[Shining Academy]], uses many terms directly from [[Lingua Alta]]. 

# Theory
The fundamental principle upon which all human magical knowledge is based is the  Coincidentia Oppositorum_, or the _Unity of Opposites_. When two opposing predicates coincide to form a whole, a controllable energy is released, usually identified with Magic. The specific construction of such a union is also known as a [[Dialectic]].

A thorough understanding of the various [[Natural Philosophy|laws of nature]], as well as mathematical and para-philosophical concepts, is essential to provide a solid foundation in which physical contradictions can be formulated and thus Dialectically united. 

In a correct manifestation of a magically potential Dialectic, the original predicates not only remain intact but the entirety of the construction (both the predicates and the result of the coincidence) must in some way be greater than the sum of its parts.

A commonly used example is the [[Dialectic]] of [[Wild Magic]]. The inherent contradiction invoked is a societal one. On one hand, the Mage, often a healer, is a vital part of society. On the other hand, due to their abilities, they are distrusted and avoided.

The coincidence of these opposing societal roles forms the source that enables the fulfiller of these roles to manifest the [[Dialectic]] in the form of [[Ways and Means|Ways]], [[Ways and Means|Means]], or even Spells.

In this example, the societal function of the Healer-Mage is thus the result of the [[Dialectic]] coincidence. Their role does not undo the original predicates but rather reinforces them. After all, with access to [[Ways and Means|Ways]], the healer's repertoire expands, but so does the generated mistrust.

In this process, it is not necessary for the Mage to be aware of the contradiction upon which their existence as a Mage rests. However, if one of the two predicates is removed, for example, if the Mage is cast out from their community, they will notice their grip on magical processes diminishing or even disappearing.

Some [[Ways and Means|Artisinal Ways]] work in a similar manner. When the underlying craft does not invite a societal Dialectic, the underlying Dialectic is often achieved through a deliberate undermining of that craft. A [[Ways and Means|Way]] for crafting a waterproof boot may require skilfully and thoroughly perforating the leather.

For the [[Natural Philosophy|Natural-Philosophical]] wizard, this Dialectic is also of a [[Natural Philosophy|Natural-Philosophical]] nature and relies entirely on the wizard's capacity to effectuate the [[Dialectic]]. However, correctly internalizing the concepts necessary for an internal philosophical [[Dialectic]] requires many years of education and self-study.
