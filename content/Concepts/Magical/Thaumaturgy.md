# Thaumaturgy
Thaumaturgy is the name given to the Arcane [[Magic|Magical]] traditions practiced in [[Tel Varesh]] and the [[Vareshian Commonwealth|Commonwealth]]. It is one of the eleven noble arts taught at the [[High-Schul of Tel Varesh]].

Thaumaturgy distinguishes itself aesthetically by its strong reliance on blood and tissue, both human and Animal, in accordance with the [[Seven Elements]] and the [[Litany of Creation]]. Rituals often include blood, and animals. Of particular magical importance are moths, snakes, owls, and eels. 

Thaumaturgy is considered to be related to the energy of life itself, and hence all spells and rituals must include some (allusion to) death in order for the spell to be bounded and hence effective.

As opposed to the [[Hermetic Philosophy]] practiced in the [[Crucible]], thaumaturgy has embraced [[Necromancy]] as a noble art that allows [[Veneration of the Dead|communication with the dead]].

Practitioners are expected to have high pain thresholds, good posture and great discipline.
