# The Blood Oath

Probably the Shining Academy's most infamous policy is the so-called [[Blood Oath]], also called the Sanguine Promise. This oath states that if an outsider is responsible for the death of a [[Magus]], they will be punished in equal measure. It is the responsibility of all [[Magus|Magi]], but especially the [[Bondsmage|Bondsmagi]], to make this happen.
