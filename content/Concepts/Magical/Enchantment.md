Enchantment describes the use of [[Magic]] to subvert the free will of any sapient person. As such, it is often amongst the most feared forms of [[Magic]] in the [[Crucible]], more so even than [[Necromancy]].

The [[Six Tenets|Fourth Tenet]] of the [[Iomedaean Canon]] explicitly forbids the use of Enchantment [[Magic]] on sapient people, and the [[Book of Canon Law]] makes this even clearer by prescribing a death sentence on those that practice it. 

Many crimes atrocities have been blamed on enchantments supposedly laid by [[Wild Magic|witches]]. 

[[Hermetic Philosophy]] outright forbids the use of enchantments and even [[Thaumaturgy]] does not look upon enchantment kindly, and restricts its use on criminals and other unpersons.
