Necromancy is a branch of [[Magic]] that involves communication with, manipulation of, or influence over the dead in either body or soul. Practitioners, known as necromancers, often seek to interact with spirits, summon the souls of the dead, and some may even use the bodies of the dead to serve their purposes.

Within the [[Crucible]], necromancy is seen as one of vilest uses of Dark [[Magic]], akin in many ways to [[Enchantment]], and is thought to be used by [[Wild Magic|witches and warlocks]] in their dark rituals. 

The [[Six Tenets|Fourth Tenet]] of the [[Church of Iomedae]] is generally interpreted as actively prohibiting the practice of necromancy on unwilling subjects. Furthermore, the [[Nine Parables|Parabel of the Sorcerer]]  warns against wanton use of such [[Magic|magics]]. While the [[Book of Canon Law]] does not explicitly outlaw all uses of necromancy, all but the most progressive [[Asynodal Churches of Iomedae|Asynodal Churches]] reject the practice outright. 

The department of [[Hermetic Philosophy]], and most other respectable [[Hermetic Lodge|Hermetic Lodges]], have officially spurned any study of necromancy.

As opposed to the [[Hermetic Philosophy]] practiced in the [[Crucible]], the [[Thaumaturgy]]  of [[Tel Varesh]] has embraced [[Necromancy]] as a noble art that allows [[Veneration of the Dead|communication with the dead]]. Family members may even volunteer their bodies in death to guard the tombs as undead guardians.
