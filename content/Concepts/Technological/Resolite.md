Resolites are small opaque [[Alchemy|Alchemically]] produced crystals, with peculiar [[Natural Philosophy|Philosophical]] properties, that make them the core working component of [[Facsimile Machine|Facsimile Machines]], [[Sonofax|Sonofaxes]] and [[Vocofax|Vocofaxes]] alike. Resolites are generally made in pairs, or "Isomoprhs", which can communicate with eachother by [[Anætherial Resonance|Philosohpical means]].

When a [[Miasma]]-[[Holtzmann-Effect|induced]] [[Electricity|current]] is applied to a Resolite, it produces it causes certain [[Anætherial Resonance|Anætherial Vibrations]]. These vibrations cause any sufficiently isomorphic Resolite to also vibrate, allowing for near instantaneous long distance communication.

Facsimile machines translate these vibrations into mechanical motions, whereas [[Sonofax]] and [[Vocofax]] devices translate these vibrations into sound waves instead.

Most Resolites are manufactured by affiliates of the [[Guild of Alchemists]]. While the process of creating single pairs of Resolites has been deciphered by non-members, the process of creating large isomorphic batches, such as those utilized by the [[Sonofax]] and [[Vocofax]] system remains a trade secret.

An even more jealously guarded secret is the creation of Metasphyctic Resolites, being resolites capable of being tuned to variety of different modes, and thus being able to interact with a spectrum of different Resolites. Non-sanctioned [[Natural Philosophy|Philosophers]] known as [[Hitcher|Hitchers]] have been known to "hitch on" to  different [[Facsimile Machine|Facsimile]] networks using these Metasphyctic resolites. 

## Dimodal and Monodal Resolites
While most produced resolites are Dimodal in operation, in that they can both send and receive, one of the more recent inventions is the fabrication of Monodal Resolites. Monodal resolites are only capable of receiving transmission, but do not themselves produce any [[Anætherial Resonance|Anætherial Vibrations]].
