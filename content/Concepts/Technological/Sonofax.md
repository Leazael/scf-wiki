The Sonofax, short for Sonic [[Facsimile Machine|Facsimile]], is device similar to a [[Vocofax]], except that it is usually equipped with an array monodal [[Resolite|Resolites]], and an amplification cone. This allows a Sonofax to receive and project sound messages. 

Generally, Sonofaxes are sold without [[Resolite|Resolites]], which can be bought separately. These [[Resolite|Resolites]] are tuned to a specific sound-stage, which can provide various forms of music and other audio entertainment. These [[Resolite|Resolites]] typically last for a period between 4 and 8 weeks, depending on usage.

[[Kinescope]] programs are often accompanied by sonofox to provide the show with sound and music.
