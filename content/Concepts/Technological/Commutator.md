A commutator is a [[Natural Philosophy|Philosophical]] device that uses lodestones to create [[Electricity]]. 

Small commutators are generally significantly less potent than a small [[Holtzmann-Effect|Holtzmann Generator]], and are hence rarely utilized. 

Large steam-commutators are, however, more reliable then [[Holtzmann-Effect|Holtzmann Generators]], even if more [[Miasma]] gets lost in heat. These larger commutators are often used to power [[Reichenbach Resonator|Reichenbach Resonators]] to power many individual small appliances.
