Electricity is one of the [[Elementary Philosophical Forces]] that has seen much [[Natural Philosophy|Philosophical]] development of the last decades. 

Electricity can be used to power all manner of [[Natural Philosophy|Philosophical]] devices with much more control than by direct application of steam or [[Miasma]].

Most devices generate their own electricity from [[Miasma]] by use of the [[Holtzmann-Effect]], though larger devices often make use of [[Commutator]] instead, as they are generally more reliable at larger scales.

Electric current can be easily and cheaply distributed through the use of copper wires. However, as large electrical networks tend to provoke [[Gremlin]] infestations, long range transmission, up to several kilometres, is usually performed using a [[Reichenbach Resonator]], or, more rarely, by the application of [[Gremlin]]-resistant silver cables.
