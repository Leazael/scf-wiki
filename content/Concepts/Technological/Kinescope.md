A Kinescope is a [[Natural Philosophy|Philosophical]] device capable of displaying images in rapid succession to provide the illusion of movement. 

Kinescope-stories are used as a means of propagating recent events in Kine-reels, or as a means of entertainment. Popular stories often involve historical characters, re-enectments of popular novels, or, the dramatic escapades of [[Sophist|'Sopher Heroes]].

It is often accompanied by [[Sonofax]] connected to a centralized soundstage to provide dialogue and sound-effects.
