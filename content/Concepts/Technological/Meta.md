Metas, short for Meta-Clockworker, are a [[Natural Philosophy|Applied Philosophers]] who specialize in the modification of the inner meta-clockwork of [[Ordinator|Ordinators]] usually through the application of punch cards.

Most Metas are trained by the [[Guild of Clockworkers]], though the [[Academy of Wei√üenfels]] has in recent years expanded its applied [[Natural Philosophy|Philosophy]] deperatment to include [[Ordinator|Meta-Clockwork]] in its curriculum.

Metas and [[Ordinator|Ordinators]] are often employed in order to secure the various [[Facsimile Machine|Facsimile]] networks with encryption methods, to protect them from [[Hitcher|Hitchers]], who may attempt to listen in on these networks through the use of [[Resolite|Metasphyctic Resolites]]. In turn, these [[Hitcher|Hitchers]] have developed into a type of rogue Metas themselves, employing [[Ordinator|Ordinators]] in attempts to decrypt the messages. 

Metas often dabble in [[Ways and Means|petty]] [[Hermetic Philosophy|spells]], both to aid in their work and mental calculations, and in order to protect their machinery, systems and networks from [[Gremlin]] infestations. Some have supposedly even developed [[Ways and Means|Ways]] to summon [[Gremlin|Gremlins]] into the [[Ordinator|Ordinators]] of their rivals and competitors.
