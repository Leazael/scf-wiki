# The Iomedaean Canon
The [[Church of Iomedae]] endorses four main literary works: 
- The [[Three Lays]], outlining the life and Apotheosis of [[Iomedae]]
- The [[Six Tenets]], a set of rules by which to live.
- The [[Nine Parables]], with lessons deemed important by the faith.
- The [[Book of Canon Law]]

Together, these works are known as the *[[Iomedae|Iomedaean]] Canon* or the Teachings. While the original Canon was written in the [[Celestial]] Tongue, they are more commonly available in [[Anglic]]. Since the invention of the printing press and movable type, the Canon has become one of the most printed books in the [[Crucible]].
