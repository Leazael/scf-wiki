# The Six Tenets
(De Zes Geboden)

The Second part of the [[Iomedaean Canon]] of the [[Church of Iomedae]], consisting of six rules which the faithful ought to abide by. They were allegedly dictated by [[Iomedae]] herself after her apotheosis.

### Thou shalt not commit murder
This tenet prohibits the unlawful and unwarranted taking of a sentient life.

### Thou shalt not steal
This tenet prohibits stealing, though it is commonly interpreted to also prohibit adultery.

### Thou shalt not bear false witness
This tenet prohibits lying and oath breaking.

### Thou shalt not enslave
This tenet prohibits the taking of slaves and even makes sure that serfs are allowed a certain degree of freedom, if only the freedom to leave. It also prohibits the manipulation of another's mind through charms and compulsions. Finally, it protects the bodies and souls of the dead from [[Necromancy]].

### Thou shalt not honour any gods above me
This tenet is commonly interpreted as the prohibiting of worshipping other gods. It does not prohibit the veneration of spirits and ancestors.

### Thou shalt watch over thine kin and kind
This tenet protects members of the community from harmful neglect and outside dangers. It also mandates a certain amount of charity from those that can afford it.
