# The Six Tenets
(De Zes Geboden)

The Second part of the [[Iomedaean Canon]] of the [[Church of Iomedae]], consisting of six rules which the faithful ought to abide by. They were allegedly dictated by [[Iomedae]] herself after her apotheosis.

### Thou shalt not commit murder
This tenet prohibits the unlawful and unwarranted taking of a sentient life.

### Thou shalt not steal
This tenet prohibits stealing, though it is commonly interpreted to also prohibit adultery.

### Thou shalt not bear false witness
This tenet prohibits lying and oath breaking.

### Thou shalt not enslave
This tenet prohibits the taking of slaves. It also generally interpreted as prohibiting the manipulation of another's mind through [[Enchantment|Enchantments]] ass well as protecting the bodies and souls of the dead from [[Necromancy]].

### Thou shalt not honour any gods above me
This tenet is commonly interpreted as the prohibiting of worshipping other gods. It does not prohibit the veneration of spirits and ancestors.

### Thou shalt shield thine kin from neglect and harm
This tenet protects members of the community from harmful neglect and outside dangers. Interpretations often also mandate a certain amount of charity from those that can afford it.
