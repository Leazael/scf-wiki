# The Star of Iomedae

The star of [[Iomedae]] is one of the principle symbols of the [[Church of Iomedae]]. The symbol itself was adopted by [[Iomedae]] herself, as well as her [[Twelve Paladins]] during their [[Rupture of the Æther|Raid on the Heavens]].

The symbol itself is that of an upright [unicursal hexagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicursal_hexagram). 

Some [[Asynodal Churches of Iomedae|Asynodal Churches]], in particular those that reject the [[Dimmerschluß Creed]], have taken to displaying the star sideways.
