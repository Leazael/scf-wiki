# Dimmerschluß Creed
A common creed adopted in 1762 by the [[Sosulkan Churches of Iomedae]], the [[Orthodox Synodal Church of Iomedae]] (i.e., the [[Synodal Church of Iomedae]]) as well as several [[Asynodal Churches of Iomedae|Asynodal Churches]] in the wake of their joint intervention during the [[Thanatogenic Ghost Storm]] caused by a failed [[Yádor|Yádorian]] mass-invastion.

As the name suggests, the creed was formulated in the [[Ilmbund|Ilmian]] city of [[Dimmerschluß]].

The creed highlights the following topics:
 - [[Iomedae]] is the only [[God]] worth worshipping.
 - [[Iomedae]] was a mortal woman, and in her role of deity unites both mortal and divine qualities into a single ineffable, but imperfect being.
 - [[Iomedae]] is the only deity capable and willing to provide mortal souls with salvation in the afterlife.
 - The acceptance of the [[Iomedaean Canon]] as a guide to a righteous life.

The creed explicitly rejects the [[Heresy|Heresies]] of [[Perfectionist Iomedaeism]], [[Symbolic Iomedaeism]] and the worship of [[Protokyriatic Deism|Protokyriatic Deities]].

The creed itself is neutral on the topic of [[Iomedae|Iomedaen]] representation, and does not necessitate obedience to the [[Arcadia|Arcadian]] Throne, i.e., Priest-Queen [[Mary VIII]].
