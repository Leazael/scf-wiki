# The Three Lays
(De Drie Liederen)
The first part of the [[Iomedaean Canon]] of the [[Church of Iomedae]]. the Three Lays are long narrative poems that detail the birth and death of [[Iomedae]] and the founding of the [[Church of Iomedae]]. Parts of the Lays are often sung during mass and festivals.

The Lays themselves were supposedly written in the years after her apotheosis. It is said that when Iomedae heard the Three Lays for the first time, she shed three tears; an event that is itself described in the [[Three Lays|Lay of Stone]].

###  The Lay of Steel
The first Lay narrates the foretelling and the birth of [[Iomedae]], and her early life as a shield-maiden.

### The Lay of Blood 
The second Lay tells of a great [[Rupture of the Ã†ther|cataclysm]] that tore the world asunder. It then deals with [[Iomedae]]'s rejection of the existing [[God|gods]], and her assault on the heavens, backed by her [[Twelve Paladins]]. At the start of the assault she discards her [[Scabbard of Iomedae|Scabbard]], vowing to slay all [[God|gods]] who oppose her. Having conquered the heavens though, she finds herself still filled with righteous wrath, symbolised by her unsheathed sword, and thus unable to become the [[God|god]] that her people need. In her final act of mercy she sheathes her sword in her own blood and flesh. This sacrifice is what results in her final apotheosis.

### Lay of Stone 
The third and final Lay tells of the founding of the [[Church of Iomedae]] and the establishment of her priesthood. It is told from the viewpoint of the [[Twelve Paladins]].

Throughout the [[Three Lays|Lay of Stone]] she appears in increasingly divine apparitions to the surviving [[Twelve Paladins|Paladins]]. Here she guides the greater [[Saint|Saints]] in the founding of the [[Church of Iomedae|Church]]. She also hands down the [[Six Tenets]], relates the [[Nine Parables]] and listens to the [[Three Lays]], which move her to tears.
