# The Three Lays
(De Drie Liederen)
The first part of the [[Iomedaean Canon]] of the [[Church of Iomedae]]. the Three Lays are long narrative poems that detail the birth and death of [[Iomedae]] and the founding of the [[Church of Iomedae]]. Parts of the Lays are often sung during mass and festivals.

The Lays themselves were supposedly written in the years after her apotheosis. It is said that when Iomedae heard the Three Lays for the first time, she shed three tears; an event that is itself described in the [[Three Lays|Lay of Stone]].

###  The Lay of Steel
The first Lay narrates the foretelling and the birth of [[Iomedae]], and her early life as a shield-maiden.

### The Lay of Blood 
The second Lay tells of a great [[Rupture of the Ã†ther|cataclysm]] that tore the world asunder. It further describes how [[Iomedae]] and her [[Twelve Paladins]] stormed the heavens in an attempt to force the gods to take responsibility. The lay ends with the gods refusing to help, causing [[Iomedae]] to take action into her own hands. Wresting the divine power from the hands of the gods, she ascends to godhood and uses her newfound power to protect her people.

### Lay of Stone 
The third and final Lay tells of the founding of the [[Church of Iomedae]] and the establishment of her priesthood. It is told from the viewpoint of the surviving [[Twelve Paladins]].
