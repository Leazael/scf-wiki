# Veneration of the Dead
The Veneration of the Dead is a religious practice practiced by many cultures of the forge.

## Sainthood in the [[Church of Iomedae]]
Within the [[Church of Iomedae]], particular devout or heroic faithful may be venerated as [[Saint|Saints]]. The worship of these saints is often regional, with the exception of the [[Twelve Paladins]]. People may pray to these [[Saint|Saints]] to intercede on their behalf with [[Iomedae]] herself.

## [[Half-Ork|Half-Orcs]] of the [[Crucible]]
[[Half-Ork|Half-Orcish]] communities through the [[Crucible]] also practice the Veneration of the Dead.

The [[Half-Ork|Half-Orcish]] religious traditions revolve around two main principles. The first is that all [[Half-Ork|Half-Orcs]] are members of one unified family. As such practitioners are expected to extend charity to any [[Half-Ork]], as if they were kin. The second is that the ancestors, both malign and benevolent, keep watching over their descendants after death and play a large role in the lives of any [[Half-Ork]]. These ancestors are worshipped to ensure the ancestors' continued well-being and positive disposition towards the living, and sometimes to ask for special favours or assistance

Most [[Half-Ork|Half-Orcish]] families have a Preacher or Elder, who keeps the stories of the ancestors of that particular family-branch alive. This Elder also plays a role at important events, such as births, marriages and funerals. At such occasions, the Elder often blesses the child, spouses or the deceased in the name of the ancestors.

Usually [[Half-Ork|Half-Orcish]] households have a shrine containing depictions and relics from particular ancestors. Often this shrine also incorporates symbols of the local religion as well. Many families have a set of ancestral weapons. In some families, these are bestowed upon young half-orcs as a rite of passage.

Especially in regions where the day of rest on Sun's Eve is observed, it is common for [[Half-Ork|Half-Orcish]] parents and children to gather during dinner and break bread together, while telling stories and singing songs about the ancestors. In parts of the [[Crucible]] where the day of rest is not observed, this day can fall on any day, but is still repeated each week. The Elder often visits different family-dwellings in turn.

During the lasts week before mid-winter, it is common to light a candles each day, while singing particular songs that are to banish away the darkness and ward off the malevolent intent of evil ancestors.

Usually, each family has a large book that contains the family tree, as well as tales and songs relating to that family. During weddings it is common to add the branches of the newly-weds to the other family's tree.


## [[Tel Varesh]]
The people of [[Tel Varesh]] and the [[Vareshian Commonwealth]] hold many of the beliefs in common with the [[Half-Ork|Half-Orcs]] described above. However, the veneration of the dead is not restricted to those of [[Half-Ork|orcish]] descent. 

Furthermore, in [[Tel Varesh]], one set of ancestors are universally venerated, often referred to as the [[Primal Ancestors]], who are served by a mysterious masked priesthood.
