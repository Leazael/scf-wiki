Dragons were large creature, monsters or [[God|gods]] (or perhaps all three) that roamed the earth, skies and seas of the Word before the [[Rupture of the Æther]].

After the [[Rupture of the Æther]], references to only two dragons remain: [[Tiamat]], the former empress of [[Nachýr]], and [[Vahamut]] the newly dead [[Kovold]] [[God|deity]]. 

The word for [[Dragon]] is synonymous with [[God]] in the [[Draconic]] language which has led to some controversial depictions of other [[God|deities]] wrought by some [[Kovold|Kovolds]].
