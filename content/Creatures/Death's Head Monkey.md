# Death's Head Monkey

While originally native to the South-Western jugles of [[Nach√Ωr]], the monkeys can nowadays be commonly found in [[Tel Varesh]] and other large urban areas. They are commonly kept as pets, used as messengers, and can be found in stray packs living in abanoned atticks and alleys.

Occasianally [[Thaumaturgy|Thaumaturges]] may bind [[Angel|empyreal spirits]] to these monkeys to create winged servitors.
