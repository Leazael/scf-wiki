Gremlins are small pseudo-corporeal creatures that make their home inside of [[Electricity]] networks and other sufficiently complex [[Electricity|Electric]] machinery, especially [[Electricity|Electric]] [[Ordinator|Ordinators]].

While expensive, the most reliable way to keep these creatures at bay, is by ensuring that all electrical components of a machine are made of silver. More cost effectively though, most modern [[Meta|Metas]] learn some minor [[Ways and Means|Ways]] that allow them to ward their equipment from their detrimental effects. Consequently, this has led to [[Hitcher|Hitchers]] developing their own [[Ways and Means|Means]] of actively summoning these creatures in whatever system they wish to disrupt.

While gremlins are mostly known for infecting [[Electricity|Electrical]] networks, other sufficiently complicated [[Natural Philosophy|Philosophical]] systems have been shown to generate their own gremlin-like spirits. Some have even speculated that gremlins are nothing more than a modern and new type [[Fair Folk|Fairy]], tied to such a system.
