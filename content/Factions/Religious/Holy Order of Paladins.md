The Order of Paladins is foremost a military faction within the [[Synodal Church of Iomedae]] that is controlled directly by the [[Synod]]. They are named for the [[Twelve Paladins]] with whom [[Iomedae]] stormed the Heavens, as described in the [[Three Lays]].

Many cities where the [[Orthodox Synodal Church of Iomedae]], in [[Arcadia]] and [[Sosulkan Churches of Iomedae]], in [[Las]] and [[Izmoroz]] are active house a local chapter of the Holy Order of Paladins.

These Paladins are generally tasked with keeping the order on church grounds, and protecting the faithful. 

### Covenant
Covenant houses not one, but three different Chapters. 

The first, the Urban Chapter, is essentially an extension of the [[Covenant|Covenantâ€™s]] city watch. 

The second, the Synodal Chapter functions mainly as a reserve, which can be used in other places where the church is active, when local orders fail. The synodal order consists of 144 highly experienced troops, divided into 12 units of 12 men, who can be deployed as elite units where necessary

The third is the Royal Chapter and is tasked with the security of the Royal Familiy, and Priest-Queen [[Mary VIII]] in particular. The Royal chapter consists of 24 of the most tough, shrewd and experienced members the order has to offer.
