The Masked Priests of [[Tel Varesh]] are the sole organized priesthood the [[Vareshian Commonwealth]]. They are named for the polished bird-like ebony masks they wear at all times. Besides their masks, they can be recognized by their ragged black robes, and dusty tricorns.

Their primary function is to lead ceremonies in the [[Veneration of the Dead|veneration]] of the [[Primal Ancestors]], and to function as lore-keepers for the most important families of the city. The most exalted priests are also powerful [[Necromancy|necromancers]], capable of [[Thaumaturgy|enchanting]] the remains of the dead to function as [[Undead|undead]] guardians of the tombs and ossuaries of the city. 

They also use [[Necromancy|necromantic]] methods to speak with the dead, and act as mediators to provide wisdom and guidance to the allotted officials of the [[Tel Varesh|city]].

Membership of the priesthood is a high honour, and is often reserved for lesser scions of the gentry class. It is said that on joining the priesthood, the name, face and gender is stripped of the priests.
