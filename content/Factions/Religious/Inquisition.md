# The Inquisition
The inquisition is an intelligence and security force in service to the [[Synodal Church of Iomedae]] and directly overseen by the [[Synod]].

They were originally founded after the first [[Crusade]] for the explicit purpose of rooting out [[Tiamat]] worshippers from [[Arcadia]], but over the course of the last few centuries, the Inquisition has evolved into a more general purpose intelligence and security force.

The inquisition's main purpose is to root out [[Heresy]] within communities governed by the church. This has included allegation of [[Tiamat]] worship, [[Necromancy]] and other dark [[Magic|Magical]] practices.

Since the events of the [[White Revolution]] the Inquisition can officially no longer operate without cooperation of local governments, however, speciecially in rural areas, this rarely poses a significant barrier within the countries of [[Arcadia]], [[Polovina]], [[Las]] and [[Izmoroz]], as the [[Orthodox Synodal Church of Iomedae]] and the [[Sosulkan Churches of Iomedae]] are widely attended. 

The Inqunisition  and ther [[Holy Order of St. Alia]] do not overlap in jurisdiction, as the [[Holy Order of St. Alia]] is focused on rooting out [[Heresy]] *within* the church organization itself. 

The Inqusisiton is often assisted by the [[Holy Order of Paladins]] in the execution of their duties.
