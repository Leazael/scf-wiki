# Orthodox Synodal Church of Iomedae

The Orthodox Church is the name given to specifically the [[Arcadia|Arcadian]] branch of the [[Synodal Church of Iomedae]] and governs [[Arcadia]] and the largest (non-[[Las|Lassian]]) part of [[Polovina]]. 

Currently, there are 24 of the 48 [[Bishop|Archbishops]] in the [[Synod]] belong to the Orthodox Church.

The Orthodox Church recognizes the Queen of [[Arcadia]], [[Mary VIII]] as the formal head of the church and the pre-eminent representative of Iomedae.

The first split occurred during the [[Revelationary Revolution]], when more and more churches distanced themselves from the [[Synod]] and the [[Synodal Church of Iomedae]] to form different [[Asynodal Churches of Iomedae|Asynodal Churches]].

The Orthodox Church was formed after the [[Secession of '37]] in the wake of the [[White Revolution]], with the [[Sosulkan Churches of Iomedae|Sosulkan]] [[Bishop|Archbishops]] formally withdrawing from the [[Synod]]. However, since the [[Reparation of '51]], with the support of Czar [[Ivan I Czarovitch]], the two churches reconciled and once again joined thee [[Synod]] to form the larger [[Synodal Church of Iomedae]].

In 1762, the Orthodox Synodal Church of Iomedae also reconciled with many of the [[Asynodal Churches of Iomedae]] in the wake of the [[Thanatogenic Ghost Storm]], afther the [[Yádor|Yádorian]] invasion of '61. The final reconciliation took the form of the [[Dimmerschluß Creed]].
