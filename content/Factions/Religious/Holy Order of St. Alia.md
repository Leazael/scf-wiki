# The Holy Order of St. Alia
The Order of St. Alia is the Church's most notorious order, named for St. Alia, who was one of [[Iomedae|Iomedaeâ€™s]] original [[Twelve Paladins]]. The main task of the order is to combat corruption and [[Heresy]] within the [[Synodal Church of Iomedae|Church]] itself. 

It is rumoured that the members of the order are allowed to break the [[Six Tenets]] in accordance with their duties. This rumour is true and means that, in the name of the [[Synodal Church of Iomedae|Church]], and for the greater good, they may kill, lie and steal. Members may even rob others of their Free Will (by force, or by magic) and pretend to worship other gods.

The Order of St. Alia is not particularly large counts 144 members. The order is divided into 6 branches with 24 members each. The members within a branch know each other, but are not aware of the identity of the members in other branches. Only the heads of the branches have contact with each other.

Members of the Order of St. Alia generally hold a secondary "cover" position within the church, such as layman, [[Holy Order of Paladins|Paladin]] or even [[Bishop]].

They are occasionally called upon by the [[Prophetic Choir of St. Omelas]].
