# Prophetic Choir of [[St. Omelas]]

The Prophetic Choir of St. Omelas, part of the Holy Order of St. Omelas, is a holy order of the [[Orthodox Synodal Church of Iomedae]] seated in [[Covenant]] and remains one of the best kept secrets of the [[Synodal Church of Iomedae|Church]]. It is named after [[St. Omelas]]. The Order of St. Omelas does not have a strict hierarchy, though it is formally lead by the Abbot.

### History
The Prophetic Choir was has its origin nearly 1000 years ago, during the first [[Crusade]] (822 - 831) after [[St. Omelas]] rescued a [[Nachýr]] slave ship full of children. On arrival in [[Sallysport]], it was clear to the people who found the boat that it had run out of food and water days, maybe weeks ago. The crew had died of starvation. However, the children and the Saint were nevertheless found singing in the hold.


### Composition
The Prophetic Choir of [[St. Omelas]] consists of a group of usually about 60 singers, who do nothing but sing continuously, day and night. They don not sleep, they don not eat and they don not drink. However, the songs they sing are not composed, and their blind eyes would not be able to see sheet music anyway.

The choir always sings at least two songs together, and always in Celestial. What makes the choir so important is that of all the songs that are simultaneously sung, exactly one always contains the absolute truth (the Emet). The different songs split up, mix and form new groups. But there is always exactly one that contains the Emet, be it past present or future. This is what makes the choir prophetic. 

Only once has the Choir fallen silent, namely on the first day of the [[Cacotopic Warp]] of [[Holmgard]].

### The Order of St. Omelas
The Choir is tended to by the Order of St. Omelas, who fulfil three primary tasks.
- To write down everything being sung by the choir.
- To find out which of the simultaneously sung songs is the one that contains the truth. Sometimes this can be done through verification, if what is being sung has already happened. Sometimes through elimination, by falsifying the other parts being sung.
- when it is out of date what truth will (probably) come to pass, to ensure that the church is given this information.

In relation to the latter two, the Order occasionally interacts with the [[Holy Order of St. Alia]] in two ways. First, by requesting very specific, often trivial seeming information (like the numebr of cows a certain Ilmian farmer owns, or whether Earl Ziswald's dog is still alive).  Secondly, by deliviring, seemingly from nothing, highly useful information related to corruption, crime or [[Heresy]] within the [[Synodal Church of Iomedae|Church]].

In this way, the Order of St. Omelas has been able to direct the fate of [[Arcadia]] and the lands  in he [[Crucible]] around it countless times. They managed to evacuate a large part of [[Ilm's Watch]], before it was sacked by [[Tiamat]] in 1018. Furthermore, the invasion of [[Váida Khan]] (1585) was also predicted and the Choir played a part in the decision to divert [[Averion]] from [[Arcadia]].

For the most part, the Order of St. Omelas is made up of the kind of monks and nuns who don't want to do anything else all day than simply take notes, make copies and make connections. Fairly dusty types.

In addition, there are members of the order who are used to a little more field work. These folks often collaborate with the Order of St. Alia, or occasionally conduct solo fieldwork. Furthermore, it is these members who recruit new members.

The latter is done by picking a few Choirmasters from the choir and placing them in an ordinary church choir. (This process never disturbs the choirmaster. They continues to sing, even in the absence of the rest of his choir.) This is done because it sometimes happens that during mass a child, usually about 10 years old, starts singing along with the Choirmaster, and never stops there. This is how the chorus expands.
