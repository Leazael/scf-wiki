One of the [[Great Joust|Great Houses]] of [[Lethania]] before the [[Lethanian War of Separation]]. They used to be the ruling family of [[Thurandir]] and made their home in the city of [[Klingeborn]].

While the family stayed neutral during the war, they formally joined [[Polovina]] in the aftermath. Nowadays their domain has been reduced to the port-city of [[Krelich]] on the [[Rime Sea]].

They are known for breeding and riding large winged boars.
