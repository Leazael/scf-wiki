The Miliz is the name of the [[Ilmbund|Ilmian]] organization that functions as both its military police force, and its domestic intelligence agency. They are notorious for keeping its employees highly secretive and providing cover jobs for nearly all of their active force.

Their culture of secrecy also creates mistrust amongst radical organizations, as one can never quite be sure that someone *is not* working for thee Miliz.

In popular media, the Miliz is often shown as being in open conflict with the [[Sophist]].

The Miliz is reports directly [[Triumvirate of Ilmbund|Triumvirate]], a fact that has been a thorn in the eye of the [[Ilmbund|Ilmian]] parliament for decades.
