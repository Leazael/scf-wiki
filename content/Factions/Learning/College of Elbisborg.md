The College of [[Elbisborg]] is the pre-eminent place of learning in [[Ilmbund]], and is he oldest of the [[University|Universities]] in the [[Crucible]] (though younger still than the [[Exalted School of Tel Varesh]]).

The college is principally build against the [[Göllnyr Mountains|cliffs]] between the inner two [[Walls of Elbisborg|Walls]], and consists of a series halls and tall interlocking towers, stretching over the [[Walls of Elbisborg|Walls]] to either side.

The [[University]] distinguishes itself from the [[Academy of Weißenfels]] and the [[Seminary of Aldsbury]] by its, usually, more theoretical approach to [[Natural Philosophy]], and its penchant for the study of the [[Alchemy|Alchemical]]. It was at a the College that [[Catastrophe Theory]] was first formulated (though it was in [[Academy of Weißenfels|Weißenfels]] that it was first applied).

The [[Alchemy|Alchemists]] of the college still endure some notoriety since the [[Blightfire of Elbisborg|Blightfire]] of 1707, which lead to the original outbreak of the [[Altpox]]. 

The college is also famous for being the only [[University]] in the [[Crucible]] that has made a formal study of [[Magic]]. The [[Hermetic Philosophy]] department (they prefer to eschew the term "[[Magic]]"), founded by [[Arora van Finsterling|Progessor van Finsterling]], has quite successfully integrated many [[Magic|Magical]] and [[Natural Philosophy|philosophical]] ideas, especially in the field of [[Transliminal Magic|Transliminal Communication]].

One of its most famous recent alumni is the [[Automaton]] [[Rotwang the Brassman]], who graduated in 1755 and who was the first [[Automaton]] to do so.
