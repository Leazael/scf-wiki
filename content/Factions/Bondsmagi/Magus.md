# Magus
A member and [[Magic|Magical]] Practicioner of the [[Shining Academy]]. 

**The following held before the events of 1726. It is known how much of the structure of the [[Shining Academy]] remains.**

Once an accomplished [[Magus]], it is expected (but not required) to join one of the academy's many factions. Each of these factions has its own set of responsibilities. Virtually all members belong to at least one of these factions, and often even two. Only between the [[Bondsmage|Desmotes]] ([[Bondsmage|Bondsmagi]]) and [[Magus|Archons]] (rulers) is a strict separation maintained: one cannot join one of these factions if one has ever been a member of the other.

The most famous factions are the following:

1. The [[Shining Academy|Amathi]] they are not a faction proper, but rather those who have not yet become full Magi.
2. The [[Magus|Eidetes]] (Eideten) or Investigators. These are the researchers from the academy. They may use the interplanetary portals without restriction. Among the Eidetes there are many different specialized factions. The best known are the following:
	- [[Kenomancy|Kenomancers]]. [[Magus|Magi]] who specialize in the void, space and distance. (Usually part of the Transmutation school). Their powers can interact strangely with Conjuration effects, and therefore usually don't use teleportation or summoning magic.
	- [[Selenomancy|Selenomancers]]. [[Magus|Magi]] who specialize in the composition of the planets. Often experts in conjuration (creation) magic, and magic with earth descriptors. Most [[Selenomancy|Selenomancers]] specialize in studying one of the planets.
	- [[Magus|Eremites]] (Eremieten). Not a specialization, but a kind of specialist. The [[Magus|Eremites]] live  reclusively, separating for periods of several decades, often on relatively "simple" planets, or else in one of the academy's [[Magus|Ivory Towers]].
3. The [[Magus|Epistates]] (Epistaten), or craftsmen. These provide magical services to the academy. The best-known departments are the following:
	- [[Magus|Koniortes]] (Koniorten). They specialize in spell scrolls, spell books, and manage the many libraries. Any magical writing must be presented to them before it can be distributed. They are also known for the strict censorship they impose on magic that they do not consider "clean", or spells that they dismiss as "messy".
	- [[Magus|Demiurgeans]]. (Demiurgeëers) These specialize in crafting the magical tattoos available to all members. In addition, they manage all and manufacture many of the magical items and watch over the academy's Arsenal. Any magical item a Member wears must be approved by an appropriate [[Magus|Demiurgean]].
	- [[Magus|Prothmetes]] (Prothmeëen), the Gatekeepers. They take care of the magical gates to and from the academy, and guard the roads between the worlds. 
4. [[Magus|Didactes]]. The teachers and educators of the academy. Usually highly specialized.
5. [[Bondsmage|Desmotes]] (Desmoten), or [[Bondsmage|Bondsmagi]]. These are the soldier-diplomats of the academy. Usually the most trained in combat magic, the [[Bondsmage|Desmotes]] are sometimes deployed by the Archons as internal order keepers. Finally, the [[Bondsmage|Bondsmagi]] are responsible for recruiting outsiders, as well as enforcing the Blood Oath. There is always a strict separation between the[[Bondsmage|Desmotes]] and the[[Magus|Archons]].
6. [[Magus|Archons]]. Effectively the class of officials, judges and politicians.
7. [[Magus|Primarchs]] (Primarchen). [[Magus|Primarchs]] are the elite group of usually 5-10 mages, who have reached the seventh rank. They formally rule the academy, but in practice they only do this in times of dire need. The [[Magus|Primarchs]] are without exception the most powerful practicioners in the academy.
