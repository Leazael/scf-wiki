# The Shining Academy
The legendary [[Magic|Magical]] academy that is said to be the origin of the [[Bondsmage|Bondsmagi]]. Since the closing of the embassies in 1726, an event that coincided with the first [[Cacotopic Warp]] of [[Holmgard]], there has been very little interaction between the Academy and the [[Crucible]]. 

The academy used to have Embassies in [[Holmgard]], [[Sosulka]], [[Chýrusandr]] and [[Tel Varesh]]. While the former three were evacuated and closed in the wake of the first [[Cacotopic Warp]], however, the latter was absorbed by the [[Exalted School of Tel Varesh]].

The academy used to regulate a large interplanetary portal network, but that too collapsed during the events of 1726.

While the fact is no longer as widely known as it once was, the Academy was also responsible for the [[Elven Genocide]] in 1564, which, as the name suggests, was responsible for the death of most of the elven population.

The schools of [[Kenomancy]] and [[Selenomancy]] were specifically developed by the Shining Academy.

### Location
The Academy is housed on a small [[Planet|moonlet]] closely orbiting the sun.

### Population

The Shining Aademy usually hosts about 15,000 members. Of this group, ~90% are standard humanoids ([[Gnome|Gnomes]], [[Dwarf|Dwarves]], [[Human|Humans]], [[Elf|Elves]], [[Tengu]], [[Merfolk]] etc), and ~10% monstrous races (i.e. [[Aboleth|Aboleths]], [[Kitsune]], [[Illithid|Illithids]], [[Giant|Giants]], [[Serpentfolk]], [[Centaur|Centaurs]], [[Undead]], [[Garuda|Gerudas]], [[Treant|Treants]], [[Murænes|Gryndilow]], etc.). [[Human|Humans]] make up about 30% of the humanoid population. Within the humanoid races, the [[Grey Elf|Grey Elves]] are (proportionally) overrepresented (~5%). The other varieties occur in equal numbers. Only beings of the material plane are taken in by the academy. Normal mortal (i.e., not elfin or monstrous) members of the academy typically have significantly longer life expectancies, often double, but sometimes more. Among the members of the academy, the Amathi (the pupils) as well as the first-, second- and third-class [[Magus|Magi]] are represented in roughly equal numbers: each slightly more than 20%.

### Amathi & [[Magus|Magi]] (Amathen & [[Magus|Magi]])
The members of the academy can be split into two groups: the Amaath (apprentices) and the [[Magus|Magi]] (accomplished). After a person has entered the academy, they are labelled as Amaath. This group is considered to be studying, and are generally not allowed to leave the academy without the guidance of a [[Magus|Didact]] (teacher) or [[Magus|Desmot]] ([[Bondsmage]]). This period of study usually lasts ~10 years, but can be significantly longer or shorter. During this period, the [[Magus|Amaath]] is supervised by a series of Didacts.

As soon as a student deems themselves ready, they must defend themselves against a committee of [[Magus|Magi]]. If the student succeeds, they are awarded the title of Magus (first rank), as well as their tattoo. If a student fails, they must double their total study time.

### Tattoo
Each [[Magus]] possesses a Magical tattoo, usually on the left hand (or equivalent limb). This tattoo has three functions. First, it is used by members of the Academy to identify colleagues. When a fellow academy member casts Detect Magic, the tattoo is immediately visible to the caster (even through clothing). Secondly, the tattoo indicates rank within the Academy (i.e., how important you are). Third, the tattoo can be used to amplify spells.


### Rank:
A [[Magus|Magus’]] rank determines their' status relative to the rest of the academy. The first rank is the lowest, and the seventh the highest. Seventh-rank [[Magus|Magi]] are also known as [[Magus|Primarchs]]. The rank of a [[Magus]] can be read directly from the tattoo on their hand.

When a decision has to be made between [[Magus|Magi]], the number of ranks indicates the relative weight of their vote: each increase in rank gives double the weight to their vote. A [[Magus]] attains access to a rank when someone of a superior rank pronounces them "equal".

 
### [[Blood Oath]]
Probably the Academy's most infamous policy is the so-called [[Blood Oath]], also called the Sanguine Promise. This oath states that if an outsider is responsible for the death of a [[Magus]], they will be punished in equal measure. It is the responsibility of all [[Magus|Magi]], but especially the [[Bondsmage|Bondsmagi]], to make this happen.

###  Factions:
Once an accomplished [[Magus]], it is expected (but not required) to join one of the academy's many factions. Each of these factions has its own set of responsibilities. Virtually all members belong to at least one of these factions, and often even two. Only between the [[Magus|Desmotes]] ([[Bondsmage|Bondsmagi]]) and [[Magus|Archons]] (rulers) is a strict separation maintained: one cannot join one of these factions if one has ever been a member of the other.
