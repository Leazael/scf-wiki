Ildarin is the main language spoken in the countries of [[Lethania]] and [[Ilmbund]] as well as most parts of [[Polovina]].

The language is in all likelyhood descendent from the language spoken by the people who lived in [[Ilm's Watch]] and thus has its roots in the [[Previous World]].

The language has two noteworthy dialects:
- Eldmeric (or Eldmeers), which is spoken in the swampland closer to [[Eldmere]]. It is known for its harsh rolling R's and guttural G's. While this dialect used to be fairly obscure, it has grown in popularity since [[Eldmere]] became the capital of South-[[Lethanian War of Separation]] in the aftermath of the [[Lethanian War of Separation]].
- Gnomic, a fast-paced dialect with a large canon of [[Natural Philosophy|Philosophical]] shorthand, spoken by the [[Gnome|Gnomes]].
