## Draconic
The language of [[Nach√Ωr]], spoken by the [[Kovold|Kobolds]], [[Lizardfolk]] and [[Serpentfolk]].

The language has many dialects, not all of which are mutually intelligible in spoken form. However, the formal written forms are nigh identical.

Dialects of Draconic include:
- High Draconic, or Old Draconic, the supposedly made from the tongues of [[Tiamat]] and [[Vahamut]] themselves.
- Serpentine, the hissing dialect spoken by the [[Serpentfolk]] before the [[Withering Blossoms]].
- Koboldic, the most prevalent dialect, spoken by the [[Kovold|Kobolds]] and [[Lizardfolk]].

## Counting
Draconic uses a mixed base 6/base 36 number system.

The numbers from 1-36 are usually expressed using a bijective base six number system, which can be combined into a single Heirogram, with a separate symbol fro 0. 

Larger numbers use a base 36 system, making use of the symbols 0-35, with the symbol for 36 only used occasionally when expressing large round numbers.
