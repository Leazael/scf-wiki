Elvish is the language spoken by the [[Elf|Elves]]. It was supposedly the main language of [[Cinis|EldedeÃ«l]] and is quite probably still spoken on[[Elsar]].

The language was still taught at the [[Shining Academy]] before it closed its gates in 1726 AF.

Some scholars have traced several lemma's in of the language of [[Vareshian]] back to elvish roots.
