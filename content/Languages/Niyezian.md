Niyez or Niyezian is the language of [[Tel Varesh]] and the [[Vareshian Commonwealth]]. It uses a slanted righ-to-left version transposition of the [[Celestial]] alphabet.

While the language has its alphabet and much of its pronunciation in common with the [[Crucible|easter]] [[Orkish]] language, it also derives many lemmas directly from [[Elven]].
