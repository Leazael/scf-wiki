Quicksilver is a silvery-white liquid metal with a philosophical index of 80.

Quicksilver is often used in [[Alchemy|Alchemical]] processes as it is able to dissolve gold, silver, [[Kavorinium]], but not [[Mythril]]. Quicksilver is also the only material known to be able to dissolve depleted [[Miasma]], which itself is an essential step of the [[Holtzmann-Effect]].
