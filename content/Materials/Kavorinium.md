Kavorinium, sometimes simply called Kavor, is a light, silver-white metal, with a [[Philosophical Index]] of 13.

While sometimes said to be so light that it is unaffected by gravity altogether, this is in fact false. However, it is still a very practical light-weight metal that used for construction when weight is an important factor, especially in aeronautics.

The raw ore, also known as Kavorite, can be found in the [[Göllnyr Mountains]], the north-eastern branch of the [[Fomorian Mountains]] as well as in the mountains near the [[Lethanian Colonies]] in [[Nachýr]].
