Dwarves are a short and stocky race, and stand about a foot or two shorter than most humans, with wide, compact bodies that account for their burly appearance. Male and female dwarves pride themselves on the long length of their hair, and men often decorate their beards with a variety of clasps and intricate braids. Females dwarves do not grow beards, but usually have pronounced sideburns. 

Fiercely traditionalist and conservative, many dwarves still prefer to toil the hills and mountains for gems and minerals. These dwarves make their home in the [[Fomorian Mountains]] and of course [[Dvårgheim]]. It is said that the mountains bordering the [[Widdersin Ocean]] in [[Izmoroz]] house a sizable dwarven community. Furthermore, it is reported that a sizable minority of the coastal cities in [[Thrjoskarland]] are made up of dwarves, as are the nomadic [[Thrjoská]] that roam that land.

Throughout the last 100 years, several of the mines in the Fomorian Mountains have dried up, resulting in an influx of dwarves seeking labour in parts of [[Polovina]] and [[Lethania]].

Mainly these dwarves have either moved to the cities, formed their own strongly xenophobic farming communities or found work as laborers on one of the many rail-road projects, while a few rare groups have made the journey to [[Dvårgheim]].

Dwarves are a long lived race, with individuals more often than not reaching 300 years. Despite their difference in appearance and stature, Dwarves have much in common with [[Gnome|Gnomes]], and the two races are known to occasionally intermarry.

*Dwarves are an amalgam of Tolkien Dwarves and the Dwarves of Northern mythology. They often have Nordic sounding [[Dvårgish]] first names, but translate their last name depending on context.*

### Demographics
Dwarves make up about 5% of the population of the central [[Crucible]], with a slightly higher percentage in some urban areas. In the Fomorian Mountains and in [[Dvårgheim]] dwarven communities that consist up to 95% of dwarves can be commonly found.

### Professions
Any (especially in their own communities), though they are renowned for their mining, metallurgy and engineering. Many of the train-tracks now crisscrossing the [[Crucible]] are the result of dwarven labour.

### Religion
Most dwarves worship the [[Æsir]], though in the west and in more [[Human]]-dominant communities [[Iomedae]] [[Church of Iomedae|worship]] is more commonly found. In the far west, in [[Izmoroz]], many dwarves till worship a version of the [[Old Sosulkan Gods]].
