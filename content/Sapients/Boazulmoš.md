The Boazulmo≈° are a type of [[Centaur]] native to the tundras of [[Thrjoskarland]] and [[Nichija-Zembla]]. Superficially, they resemble half-man and half-reindeer, with adults often sprouting short antlers. 

Their dense fur gives them a more animalistic look than traditional centaurs, though they are known to be staunch pacifists.
