# Half-Ork
Half-Orks are usually of an equal height with [[Human|Humans]], with powerful builds and greenish, greyish or olive skin. Their lower canine teeth often grow long enough to protrude from their mouths, and these “tusks,” combined with heavy brows and slightly pointed ears, give them their notoriously bestial appearance.  

While the name half-Ork suggests a [[Human]] lineage, similar to [[Half-Elf|Half-Elves]], this is not actually the case. Apart from cultural and societal norms, there is no biological difference between the Half-Orks and the more "primitive" [[Ork|Orks]] from [[Las]]. Still, many [[Half-Ork|Half-Orks]] from the [[Crucible]] prefer the term, as it connotes with civilization and refinement. In contrast, the [[Half-Ork|Half-Orks]] form the [[Vareshian Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] of [[Tel Varesh]] prefer to be referred to as "Orks", a fact that the people from the [[Crucible]] tend to ignore

The half-Orks are a hard working and progressive people, always striving to improve their place in society. While they usually succeed in integrating fully into any society they are part of, half-Orks still seek each other out and remember their old traditions. All half-Orks consider each other part of their family and denying another half-Ork charity is considered a grievous offence. They only occasionally intermarry with other humans. In such unions, the child is almost always indistinguishable from a half-Ork.

The half-Orks of the [[Crucible]] have their own common tongue, often referred to as [[Orcish]].

### Demographics
Within the [[Crucible]], Half-Orks make up about 5% of the population, and up to 10% in urban areas. They make up about 70% of the population of [[Tel Varesh]].

### Profession
Their loyalty to their family and familiarity with others of their kind has caused many banks, moneylenders and merchant guilds to be either half-Ork-owned or half-Ork-run. Especially the [[Ilmbund|Ilmian]] [[Guild of Bankers and Brokers]] has a sizable half-Orkish minority amongst its members.

### Religion
While they usually conform to the dominant religion of the region they live in, they also practice a form of [[Veneration of the Dead]]. Once every week family comes together to break bread and remember the stories, trials and accomplishments of their [[Veneration of the Dead|Ancestors]].
