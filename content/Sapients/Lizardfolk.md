# Lizardfolk
Lizardfolk are a race of reptilian humanoids, native to [[Nachýr]]. The term Lizardfolk actually encompasses three different types of related reptilian humanoids
- True Lizardfolk, the all-female predominant species, who comprise essentially all "civilized" Lizardfolk.
- Feral Lizardfolk, also called Troglodytes. A rare nocturnal subspecies who supposedly live in the mountains on the South-Western coast of [[Nachýr]]. A few individuals have been spotted living in [[Vareshian Colonies|Kef Hattikvah]]. 
- The Highborn or Dragonborn Lizardfolk. A subspecies that was supposedly once part of the [[Nachýr|Nachýrian]] ruling classes together with the [[Serpentfolk]], until the latter fully supplanted the former in an act of genocide.

While superficially resembling [[Kovold|Kobolds]], Lizardfolk are not closely related and take offence at such ideas, as Lizardfolk consider kobolds to be impulsive and dim-witted.

### Physiology
Lizardfolk are, like [[Kovold|Kovolds]], poikilothermic, and only partially generate their own heat. While inactive, their core temperatures can drop quite drastically, resulting in lethargy. 

Despite the fact that true Lizardfolk are an all-female species who reproduce through parthenogenesis, they still engage in mating behaviour. In fact, it is well known among the Lizardfolk themselves that ovulation in contingent on such behaviours.

It is hypnotized that these True Lizardfolk are in fact a heterotic interspecific hybridization of the Dragonborn and Feral Lizardfolk, and it is the hybridization of these species the prevents healthy males from forming.
