aliases: [Goblins, Hobbelijn]

Goblins are a small, rarely taller than 3 ft., race of humanoids known for their fierce appearance due to their claws and sharp teeth. Their skin has a greenish tinge and they posses large yellow eyes and pointed ears. Their hands and feet are, proportionally, slightly larger than a [[Human|human's]], and end in large claws possessing, unlike other primates, a subunguis. 

Goblins are mainly native to [[Las]] and [[Izmoroz]].

Due to their skin, and their many assume that Goblins may be related to [[Ork|Orcs]], however, they are in fact closely related to (and may be in fact the same species as) [[Halfling|Halflings]].
