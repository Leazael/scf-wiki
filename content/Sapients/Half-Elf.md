Half-elves stand taller than [[Human|Humans]] but shorter than [[Elf|Elves]]. They inherit the lean build and comely features of their [[Elf|Elven]] lineage, but their skin colour is normally dictated by their [[Human]] side. 

While half-elves retain the pointed ears of [[Elf|Elves]], theirs are more rounded and less pronounced. Half-elves tend to have [[Human|Humanly]] shaped eyes, though the colouration often matches that of the [[Elf|Elven]] parent at the time of conception.

While true half-elves are very rare, even more so than [[Elf|Elves]], people with [[Elf|Elven]] blood are still relatively common, since even individuals who are only 1/64th part [[Elf]] often still look more [[Elf]] than [[Human]]. On top of this, many half-elves choose to marry other half-elves, hence there may be many "pure" half-elves, who are only very distantly related to an actual elf.

# Life 
Most half-elves, i.e., those with mostly [[Human]] blood, tend to age at a rate similar to humans, though are often slightly longer lived. In contrast, "pure" half-elves can have wildly varying life spans, with some living up to  400 years, and some dying of old age at 100.

# Demographics
Demographics Half-elves make up less than 5% of the population and while some half-elven communities frown upon urban life, half-elves can make up about 10% of an urban population. A few isolated Half-elven communities exist within some of the larger forests of [[Fenwald]], [[Las]] and [[Dimmerwold]].

[[Dalriada]], being the home of a sizable [[Elf|Elven]] population, also counts a great number of half-elves among its population.

# Religion
Some of the isolated half-elven communities actively attempt to immitate the lives of ther [[Elf|Elven]] ancestors and hence take up [[Correllon]] worship.
