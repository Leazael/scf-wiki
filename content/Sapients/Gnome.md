aliases: Gnomes

Gnomes are one of the smallest of the common races, generally standing just over 3 feet in height. They are easily distinguishable from [[Human]] children and [[Halfling|Halflings]] by their large pointed noses, wide tapered ears and unusually ragged hair. In addition, a gnome's hair colour varies much more drastically than any other species, with some gnomes having dull orange hair while others have scarlet, umber or even bright green hair.

Gnomes are highly individualistic and sometimes competitive creatures. They pride themselves on their knowledge in [[Alchemy]] and [[Natural Philosophy]], and are renowned for their clockwork and steam-engines. They tend to be eccentric, extravagant and inventive, and while they delight in competing amongst themselves, they can also work expertly together on large projects.

Despite their wild appearances, gnomes have much in common with [[Dwarf|Dwarves]], like their habitat and occasionally temperament. It has been known for the races to intermarry. 

The Gnomes of the [[Crucible]], amongst themselves speak their own high-paced dialect of [[Ildarin]], [[Ildarin|Gnomic]].

*Unlike the Pathfinder variant, gnomes have very little to do with the fey, and are instead more akin to dwarves. Gnomes are derived from the fairy-like mediaeval creatures and the Norse Svartálfar. They often have names that sound vaguely stuttering and German, Like Artimänner, Narniddin, Daldalena, etc.*

# Life 
Gnomes can generally expect to live up to 200 years. 

# Demographics
Gnomes make up less than 5% of the population, though hardly any live in rural areas. In human cities they make up about 5-10% of the population, but sometimes as much as 30% in dwarven run communities. 

Gnomes can also be found among the nomadic [[Thrjoská]], often accompaneid by their large riding dogs.

# Professions
Urban gnomes are renowned tinkers, craftsmen and artisans and may consider jobs like farming or mining beneath them.

# Religion
While the more rural Gnomes of the [[Crucible]] generally favour the loval religions, the urban, [[Natural Philosophy|philosophically]] inclined Gnomes, generally hold [[Alatrism|Alatric]] views. 

The gnomes of [[Dvårgheim]] generally revere the [[Æsir]].
