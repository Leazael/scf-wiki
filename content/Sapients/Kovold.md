# Kovold 
Kovolds or Kobolds are a small race of reptilian humanoids, native to [[Nachýr]]. They have powerful jaws for creatures of their size and noticeable claws on their hands and feet. Depending on their parentage, Kovolds’ thick hides vary in colour, and may have various sized horns on their necks, jawline or on the top of their head. 

Kovolds age rapidly compared to other races, reaching physical maturity in less than 10 years. They usually become aware while still inside their egg. Their egg-memories usually include sounds and sensations experienced while unhatched, and are often spoken of with some reverence.

While superficially resembling [[Lizardfolk]], Kovolds are not closely related and take offense to such hypotheses, as Kovolds consider them to be slow and dim-witted.

### Culture
Kovoldic culture, like [[Nachýr|Nachýrian]] culture has very strict and complicated rules pertaining to ownership and property, that include various concepts of slavery. 

Kovolds keep both large insects (beetles, lice, grasshopper) for food and for their resins and chitins,  and cockatrices (savlkeks) as beasts of burden. 

### Physiology
Kovolds are (like mole-rats and sloths) poikilothermic, and only partially generate their own heat. While inactive, their core temperatures can drop quite drastically, resulting in lethargy. As such, they often prefer to sleep in huddled groups to conserve their warmth. Temperature also determines the gender of the hatchling that emerges from an egg.

Kovolds exhibit basically no sexual dimorphism, with even individuals Kovolds usually not able to determine the sex of an individual Kovold by sight or even smell. Kovolds generally reproduce during the breeding season in late summer. During this time Kovolds become aware of each others sex, due pheromone secretion. Courtship rituals vary, but generally involve dancing and occasionally fighting. 

While rare, Kovolds are also said to be able to reproduce through parthenogenesis, protandry or sometimes both.

Female Kovolds generally lay a single, or sometimes two eggs. The eggs from a community are usually reared collectively, with no importance to the origin of eggs attached. Simiarily, the young are usually taken care of by random members of society. This has occasionally caused problems when Kovolds have interacted with other species' children, and have been accused of "stealing", the babies.

### Diet

Kovolds sustain themselves on a diet of various meats (both insects and vertebrates), roots and fruits (often fermented). They have problems digesting long plant fibres and dairy products, but can do so to survive.

While expert opinions vary, some belief that Kovolds are closely related to the [[Lizardfolk]], an opinion that Kovolds often strongly disagree with.

### Religion 
Since the disappearance of [[Tiamat]] and the death of [[Vahamut]] they mainly venerate the latter. Though some deny that [[Tiamat]] has disappeared. Before the disappearance of [[Tiamat]], Kovold priests were rare as these roles were often filled by the [[Serpentfolk]]. Instead a similar function was performed by Kovolds calling themselves [[Heretic|Heretics]]
