The Echsee is a relatively new city (founded in the last 80 years) within the modern borders of [[Ilmbund]] residing on the coast of the eponymous lake.

The founding of the city is part of a longer campaign in which [[Ilmbund]] has slowly started to expand into [[Y치dor|Y치dorian]] territory. It is possible that this expansion is one of the reasons leading up to the recent [[Y치dor|Y치dorian]] invasion in 1761 AF, and the [[Thanatogenic Ghost Storm]] that followed in its wake.
