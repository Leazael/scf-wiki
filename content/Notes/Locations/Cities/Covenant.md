Covenant is the capital of [[Arcadia]] and the seat of both the [[Synod]] of the [[Synodal Church of Iomedae|Synodal Church]] and the throne of Priest-Queen [[Mary VIII]], who has also fulfils the role of the [[Bishop|Archbishop]] of Covenant. Despite this, it is not the home of the [[Arcadia|Arcadian]] parliament, which is seated in [[Beorminster]].

While Covenant used to be ruled directly by [[Synodal Church of Iomedae|Synodal Church]], this changed after the [[White Revolution]]. Instead the city is now governed by a Mayor and an elected city council.

The city was founded not long after 526 AF, and was after [[Providence]], the one of the first cities founded by the newly arrived settlers. 

Covenant is home to the largest sea-port in the [[Crucible]], only is only rivalled by [[Angelenpoort]].
