# Summary
Nachýr is a large formar empire that liest to the west of the [[Crucible]], known for its large population of [[Kovold|Kovolds]], [[Lizardfolk]] and its former ruler [[Tiamat]].

[[Nachýr|Nachýrian]] culture has very strict and complicated rules pertaining to ownership and property, that include various concepts of slavery. This has in the past put Nachýr directly in the cross-hairs of [[Arcadia]] and the [[Church of Iomedae]], as the [[Six Tenets]] of the [[Iomedaean Canon]] denounce slavery as blasphemous. This tension has led to several wars, called the [[Crusade|Crusades]].

Nachýr shares a border with [[Izmoroz]], the [[Vareshian Commonwealth]], [[Dalriada]] and [[Lethania]].

[[Chýrusandr]] is Nachýr's largest city, and used to be it capital before the collapse of its government. The primary language of Nachýr is [[Draconic]], of which there exist many dialects.

Even before the events of the [[Withering Blossoms]] that killed most of the [[Serpentfolk]], both [[Lethania]] and [[Tel Varesh]] have started colonies (see [[Vareshian Colonies]] and the [[Lethanian Colonies]]) in the south western part of Nachýr, where many natural resources can be found. The new foreign cities [[Vareshian Colonies|Kef Hattikvah]], [[Fort Arkys]] and [[New Holmgard]] house sizable non-[[Kovold]] populations.

# History
The empire has has existed on the edges of the [[Crucible]] since time immemorial, with the lands from which it grew hailing wholly from the [[Previous World]].

The empire first came into contact with the [[Crucible]] in 577 AF, when the Empire  had advanced far enough to the north-east that it started clashing with [[Izmoroz]] south of the most southern borders of the [Nemedian Mountains]. 

The resulting war has since been called "The [[War of Frozen Chains]]", named after the battlefields littered with the frozen corpses of [[Tiamat|Tiamat’s]] slave soldiers. This dreadful war raged for over a dozen years, from 566 AF until 581 AF. 

During the relatively peaceful years, following the [[War of Frozen Chains]], trade between [[Nachýr]] and the [[Crucible]] caused the worship of [[Tiamat]] to spread to these lands as well. Even though it concerned a relatively small minority, this nevertheless provoked the established [[Church of Iomedae]] in [[Arcadia]] to the point that in 822 AF the First [[Crusade]] was launched. 


Hellbent on destroying [[Tiamat]] and all her followers, King [[Richaerd II]] of [[Arcadia]] set out with over a hundred thousand men and women in order to drive back the [[Nachýr|Dragon Empire]] from whence it came.

Although the [[Arcadia|Arcadian]] forces suffered some heavy losses and were ultimately unsuccessful in destroying the [[Nachýr|Empire]], they did manage to put an end to the constant advancement of the [[Nachýr|Empire’s]] borders. In 831 AF the remaining armies of Arcadia returned home, now led by [[Richaerd II|Richaerd II’s]] only surviving son, [[Henry II]].

Almost two hundred years after the first [[Crusade]], [[Tiamat]] decided that an end should be put to [[Arcadia|Arcadia’s]] arrogance and in 1017 AF the Counter [[Crusade]] was launched, a conflict that would last until 1021 AF. Not only did Tiamat march in force upon [[Arcadia]], she also personally laid waste to many of [[Arcadia|Arcadia’s]] most crucial allies, most notably during the [[Sack of Ilm's Watch]] in the winter of 1018 AF.

Over the next four hundred years, [[Arcadia]] would try two more times to destroy [[Tiamat]], launching two new crusades, one from 1199 AF to 1211 AF and one from 1416 AF to 1424 AF.

In 1656 AF, against the wishes and wisdom of [[Lethania]] and Ilmbund, Arcadia launched its fourth, and to this date final [[Crusade]]. After a small period of economic downfall, caused by draughts and subsequent floods, the [[Synod]] of [[Arcadia]] become more and more radicalized, to the point that the [[Inquisition]] started blaming [[Tiamat]] and [[Tiamat]] worshippers for their misfortune. These allegations came to a crescendo when finally the Priest-King [[Arcadia]] decided that [[Tiamat]] had to be stopped once and for all. 

While the [[Crusade]] raged on, the people of Arcadia were slowly starving, while all the available food was send to the front lines of the war. After a seven year long [[Crusade]] and the siege of [[Lygárnach]], which lasted three years, it was decided by [[Lethania]] and [[Ilmbund]] that this [[Crusade]] should come to an end. They rallied their forces against those of [[Arcadia]] and slowly drove the [[Arcadia|Arcadian]] armies back from [[Nachýr]] towards [[Arcadia]]. In addition, it was decided that a large part of [[Arcadia|Arcadian]] territory would be transferred to Lethania, as an independent province, ruled by a more peaceful branch of the Arcadian royal family. Thus it was in the year 1663 that the fourth [[Crusade]] ended.

Despite the [[Crusade|Crusades]] having formally ended, [[Arcadia]] still remained engrossed in a border conflict with [[Nachýr]] on the [[Step-Stone Isles]]. In 1729, Lethania, fed up again, intervened. A peace was again forced between [[Arcadia]] and [[Nachýr]], and a large part of the [[Step-Stone Isles]] became Lethanian territory.

Things quickly fell apart in the second half of the 1760s. First, in 1765, it slowly becomes apparent that a mysterious plague, called the [[Withering Blossoms]], has struck, quickly killing off the the entire caste of [[Serpentfolk]], who effectively rule the empire as administrators to [[Tiamat]]. To make things worse, at some time in 1768, it becomes clear that [[Tiamat]] has disappeared from her palace, leaving behind only the rotting corpse of [[Vahamut]]. 

The [[Kovold|Kobolds]], often rudderless with the death of their owners, seized on the opportunity to spread the good word of the death of [[Vahamut]]. The festive processions they formed to celebrate the death of their new [[God|god]], grew with many former [[Human]] slaves tacking on. Eventually, in 1769, these processions crossed the borders into [[Izmoroz]] and [[Lethania]], and from there [[Ilmbund]] and [[Arcadia]] in a mass migration known as the [[Nachýrian Exodus]].

# Races 
More than three quarters of Nachýr's population consists of [[Kovold|Kobolds]], with the remainder consisting mainly of [[Lizardfolk]] and [[Human|Humans]], both of which, until recently led an enslaved existence. Many [[Human|Humans]] have left the country, together with many [[Kovold|Kobolds]] as part of the [[Nachýrian Exodus]].

The dominant caste of [[Nachýr]] used to consist mostly of [[Serpentfolk]], however  a mysterious plague, called the [[Withering Blossoms]], first appearing in 1765, killed virtually all of them

In the south western parts of the country, many other sentient species can be found. Most notably [[Tengu]].

# Religion 
Until the [[Tiamat]] and the coinciding Death of [[Vahamut]] in 1768, [[Tiamat]] was the sole deity of [[Nachýr]]. However, since the discovery of the rotting corpse of [[Vahamut]] in that same year, [[Vahamut]] veneration has spread through the country like wildfire. 

Wild carousing processions starting from [[Chýrusandr]] spread to all the corners of the former empire. Those leaving for the east were soon joined by [[Human|Humans]] and [[Kovold|Kobolds]] that found themselves ownerless in the wake of the [[Withering Blossoms]]. These raucous processions ventured into first [[Lethania]] and [[Izmoroz]], and soon found their way into [[Arcadia]] and [[Ilmbund]], in an event known as the [[Nachýrian Exodus]]. [[Polovina]], by heavily fortifying its borders, was able to keep them out.

With the quick disappearance of the worship [[Tiamat]], many communities have found themselves without spiritual leadership. In these communities a new class of non-priest organically arose, known as the [[Heretic|Hetetics]].

# Government
Nachýr used to be autocratically ruled by [[Tiamat]], before her [[Tiamat|disappearance]] assisted by a tyrannical ruling class of [[Serpentfolk]]. However, with [[Tiamat]] gone and the [[Serpentfolk]] mostly dead from the [[Withering Blossoms]] the inhabitants of [[Nachýr]] are effectively rudderless.

Cities, villages, towns and the like have fallen back on localized self-government.
