# Summary
The Nation of Dvårgheim is a bisected country. On the one hand, there are hundreds of coastal and mountain villages, mostly inhabited by humans. On the other hand, there are the vast underground cities. Underground passageways and steam-locomotives connect these cities to form the vast underside of Dvårgheim.

Despite the apparent dwarven dominance, nearly half of the population consists of humans, who are in no way considered inferior by the native dwarves. This means that while a large part of Dvårgheim consists of dwarves, many Dvårgs are not [[Dwarf|dwarvish]]. The majority of these non-[Dwarf|dwarvish]] Dvårgs are [[Human|Humans]] living near the coast, though many non-[[Dwarf|dwarves]] can also be found in the underground settlements, performing the same type of duties as the [[Dwarf|dwarvish]] Drvårgs. Many of the Dvårgish tunnels, pathways and houses are constructed to be accessible to humans. Creating such a structure for [[Dwarf|dwarven]]-sized creatures only is considered extremely rude.

Dvårgheim borders on many countries, [[Polovina]], [[Lethania]], [[Ilmbund]], [[Yádor]], [[Nichija-Zembla]] and [[Thrjoskarland]]; though it is separated from most by the [[Göllnyr Mountains]]. 

The primary language of [[Dvårgheim]] is [[Dvårgish]]. Its capital is [[Draumdyr]].

It is considered one of the [[Philosophical Powers]].

# History
Dvårgheim was founded in 141 AF by a small group of [[Dwarf|dwarves]], now often called "The [[Founders]]". The [[Founders]], all descendent from the same tribe on the [[Previous World]], met by happy accident in the city of [[Førnheller]]. Deciding that tribes should never be sundered the way they were during that [[Rupture of the Æther]], they founded the nation of Dvårgheim, promising that all [[Dwarf|dwarves]], no matter their background would find a home in their mountains and that the nation may stand as a bulwark agains the onslaught of [[Ragnarǫk]].

Over the centuries, hundreds of tribes from all manner of [[Planet|Planets]] and [[Planet|Moons]] have moved to Dvårgheim, creating a rich and diverse mingling of dwarven cultures and traditions.

Throughout the centuries, Dvårgheim remains an isolationist country. A stance that changed in 1744 when Dvårgheim liberates the [[Lethania|Lethanian]] city [[Klingeborn]] in [[Thurandir]] from the [[Allied Forces]]. The nation of Dvårgheim was one of the official observer states during the signing of the [[Peace of Weißenfels]].

However, due to the continued [[Cacotopic Warp|Pivoting]] of [[Holmgard]], Dvårgheim officially declares the start of [[Ragnarǫk]] in 1746 and goes on lockdown for years.

Fourteen years later in 1760, the country reopens, declaring that the [[Æsir|gods]] have managed to avert the coming apocalypse. It retroactively becomes a signatory on the [[Gabel Pact]].

# Races 
Roughly half of the population of [[Dvårgheim]] consists of mountain-dwelling [[Dwarf|dwarves]]. However, the coastal regions are mainly inhabited by viking-like [[Human|Humans]]. Other races, especially [[Gnome|Gnomes]] can be found mainly in the big cities. The [[Thurmork]] forest, as well as other parts within the mountains are said to be inhabited by [[Giant|Giants]].

# Religion
The inhabitants of Dvårgheim nearly exclusively worship the [[Æsir]].

# Politics 
The country is ruled by the ninety-nine oldest willing citizens, called the Senate, situated in the capital city of [[Draumdyr]]. At the head of the Senate stands the High King or Queen, a title that passes to whoever defeats the creature called the "[[King Under the Mountains]]" and wrests the crown from the current regent. 

While extremely uncommon, there is no law barring non-dwarves from the Senate or other political offices, with even a few kings having been [[Gnome|Gnomes]] or even more rarely, [[Human|Humans]]. In fact, a popular, if apocryphal, tale narrates the brief and hectic rule of the [[Elf|Elven]] High King [[Elhandrur the Inane]].

The Senate can block the rise of a new High King, though the High King can also veto any decision made by the Senate.

The current King of Dvårgheim is the [[Dwarf|dwarven]] King [[Geirvaldr Skyhammer]].
