# Summary
Thrjoskarland is a peninsula to the north of the [[Crucible]], between the [[Muspellzee]] and [[Lokastunga]], and is generally not counted as one of the [[Philosophical Powers]]. The few cities that the country has are the coastal cities on the shores of the [[Muspellzee]] and generally inhabited by ethnically [[Dvårgheim|Dvårgian]] [[Human|Humans]]. 

Further inland, the country is mostly populated by the [[Thrjoská]] (Sámi and Komi inspired), a semi-nomadic people known for their reindeer-herding.

# Races 
The [[Dvårgheim|Dvårgian]] population consists mainly of humans, with a small minority of dwarves. The [[Thrjoská]] are more racially heterogeneous, with mix of [[Human|Humans]], non-[[Dvårgheim|Dvårgian]] [[Dwarf|Dwarves]], [[Gnome]] and [[Boazulmoš]], the Reindeer-me/[[Centaur|Centaurs]] of Thrjoskarland.

# Religion
The coastal [[Dvårgheim|Dvårgian]] population worships the [[Æsir]], however, the native [[Thrjoská]] have a highly heterogeneous system of beliefs that vary from tribe to tribe. However, they all commonly worship the giant [[Spirit Bears]] that wander the lands of the peninsula.
