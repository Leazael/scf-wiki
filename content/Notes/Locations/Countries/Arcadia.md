# Summary
A country in the south-eastern parts of the [[Crucible]]. It is the seat of the [[Orthodox Synodal Church of Iomedae]] and the [[Synod]] of [[Bishop|Archbishops]]. It is ruled by a council of elected ministers and headed by Priest-Queen [[Mary VIII]].

The capital of Arcadia is the city of [[Covenant]], which is also the home of both the Priest-Queen [[Mary VIII]] and the [[Synod]] itself. The parliament, though, is housed in the city of [[Beorminster]]. The spoken language is [[Anglic]]. It is considered one of the [[Philosophical Powers]]

The pre-eminent place of learning in Arcadia is the [[Seminary of Aldsbury]], located in [[Aldsbury]].

Arcadia has also sustained a centuries long conflict with [[Nachýr]], due to its practice of slavery, and abomination according to the [[Iomedaean Canon]] and the [[Six Tenets]] in particular.

Arcadia shares a border with [[Lethania]], [[Ilmbund]] and [[Ruïn]]. Since 1751, a large part of the Arcadian economy has come to depend on the spice imports from its colonies in [[Vahestan]].

# History
In the year 526 AF the first settlers from across the [[Wilted Ocean]] appeared on the [[Crucible]], landing on the [[Step-Stone Isles]] somewhere near the modern-day city of [[Providence]]. These settlers came by boat from a [[Vahestan|distant country]] across the ocean and settled on the shores of what would later become [[Arcadia]]. With them they brought the [[Three Lays]], the [[Six Tenets]] and the [[Nine Parables]]; the [[Iomedaean Canon]] of the [[Church of Iomedae|Church]] of [[Iomedae]]. A religion that would later be one of the foremost religions of the Crucible.

In 583 AF, the Throne of [[Arcadia]] was raised in their newly named capital of [[Covenant]] and the first Priest-King, the legendary [[St. Uther]] of [[Arcadia]], was crowned.

Over the course of several decades, [[Arcadia]] grew in size and power. By combining small local war-efforts with shrewd politics, [[Arcadia]] slowly conquered much of the thus far independent lands south of [[Ilmbund|Ilm]], until they had secured nearly all of the [[Our-Valiant-Lady Sea|White Coast]] as well as many of the islands in the [[Shimmering Straits]].

In the mean time, increased contact between the [[Crucible]] and [[Nachýr]] that caused the worship of [[Tiamat]], the Dragon-Queen of [[Nachýr]] to slowly spread out towards neighbouring countries. This provoked the established [[Church of Iomedae]] in [[Arcadia]] to the point that in 822 AF the First [[Crusade]] was launched. 

Hellbent on destroying [[Tiamat]] and all her followers, King [[Richaerd II]] of [[Arcadia]] set out with over a hundred thousand men and women in order to drive back the [[Nachýr|Dragon Empire]] from whence it came.

Although the [[Arcadia|Arcadian]] forces suffered some heavy losses and were ultimately unsuccessful in destroying the [[Nachýr|Empire]], they did manage to put an end to the constant advancement of the [[Nachýr|Empire’s]] borders. In 831 AF the remaining armies of Arcadia returned home, now led by [[Richaerd II|Richaerd II’s]] only surviving son, [[Henry II]].

Almost two hundred years after the first [[Crusade]], [[Tiamat]] decided that an end should be put to [[Arcadia|Arcadia’s]] arrogance and in 1017 AF the Counter Crusade was launched, a conflict that would last until 1021 AF. Not only did Tiamat march in force upon [[Arcadia]], she also personally laid waste to many of [[Arcadia|Arcadia’s]] most crucial allies, most notably during the [[Sack of Ilm's Watch]] in the winter of 1018 AF.

Over the next four hundred years, [[Arcadia]] would try two more times to destroy [[Tiamat]], launching two new crusades, one from 1199 AF to 1211 AF and one from 1416 AF to 1424 AF. 

Starting in 1423, and in the decades thereafter, [[Arcadia]] actively supported the [[Ilmian Revolution]].

In 1585-1586, [[Arcadia]] aided the rest of the [[Crucible]] in pushing back the invading [[Yádor|Yádorian]] hordes, and was one of the signatories at the [[Treaty of Ölmfurt]].

In 1656 AF, against the wishes and wisdom of [[Lethania]] and Ilmbund, Arcadia launched its fourth, and to this date final [[Crusade]]. After a small period of economic downfall, caused by draughts and subsequent floods, the [[Synod]] of [[Arcadia]] become more and more radicalized, to the point that the [[Inquisition]] started blaming [[Tiamat]] and [[Tiamat]] worshippers for their misfortune. These allegations came to a crescendo when finally the Priest-King [[Arcadia]] decided that [[Tiamat]] had to be stopped once and for all. 

While the [[Crusade]] raged on, the people of Arcadia were slowly starving, while all the available food was send to the front lines of the war. After a seven year long [[Crusade]] and the siege of [[Lygárnach]], which lasted three years, it was decided by [[Lethania]] and [[Ilmbund]] that this [[Crusade]] should come to an end. They rallied their forces against those of [[Arcadia]] and slowly drove the [[Arcadia|Arcadian]] armies back from [[Nachýr]] towards [[Arcadia]]. In addition, it was decided that a large part of [[Arcadia|Arcadian]] territory would be transferred to Lethania, as an independent province, ruled by a more peaceful branch of the Arcadian royal family. Thus it was in the year 1663 that the fourth [[Crusade]] ended, and that the Province of [[Averion]] became a part of [[Lethania|Lethanian]] Confederacy. 

Despite the [[Crusade|Crusades]] having formally ended, [[Arcadia]] still remained engrossed in a border conflict with [[Nachýr]] on the [[Step-Stone Isles]]. In 1729, Lethania, fed up again, intervened. A peace was again forced between [[Arcadia]] and [[Nachýr]], and a large part of the [[Step-Stone Isles]] became Lethanian territory.

While Arcadia was initially successful in staving off [[Revelationary Revolution|apocalyptic influences]] during the [[Revelationary Revolution]] (1731), it nevertheless passed many reforms to appease followers of the movement during the [[White Revolution]] in 1737. However, many [[Sosulkan Churches of Iomedae|Sosulkan Churches]] did not agree with these reforms, and [[Secession of '37|seceeded]].

In later years, Arcadia sided with [[Polovina]] (collectively known as the [[Allied Forces]]) against South-[[Lethania]] and [[Ilmbund]] during the [[Lethanian War of Separation]] (1742 - 1745).

Even after the war, [[Arcadia]] kept clashing with [[Ilmbund]] resulting in a cold war, also called the [[Silent War]]. The main cause was a series of escalations that started with a trade dispute regarding the exploitation of the [[Myrk]] swamp in Arcadia, where a significant [[Miasma]] deposit was found. The war ended after [[Ilmbund]] half-successfully tested two of its [[Swivelbomb|Swivelbombs]] in 1758. The signing of the [[Gabel Pact]] formally brought an official end to the [[Silent War]].

Arcadia and [[Ilmbund]] formally reconciled after the [[Synod]] came to the aid of the [[Asynodal Churches of Iomedae]] during the [[Thanatogenic Ghost Storm]] of 1761-1762.


# Races
The population of the Arcadia consists for the most part of humans. Hailing from far across the [[Wilted Ocean]] and only arriving in the [[Crucible]] less than two millennia ago, the humans from Arcadia are notably darker skinned than those from other countries in the [[Crucible]] often having a more Mediterranean / North African skin-tone.

Since the [[Nachýrian Exodus]] in 1769 a sizable minority of [[Kovold|Kobolds]] has entered the country and are living in encampments and slums outside of many large cities. Their presence is not well received by large parts of the country, as the [[Crusade|Crusades]] still form a large part of [[Arcadia|Arcadian]] cultural heritage.


# Religion
The people of Arcadia nearly all worship [[Iomedae]] as members of the [[Orthodox Synodal Church of Iomedae]], the (mainly) Arcadian branch of the [[Synodal Church of Iomedae]]. Membership of [[Asynodal Churches of Iomedae|Asynocal Churches]] was actually forbidden for many decades, with the guilt being branded [[Heresy|heretics]]. While some [[Bishop|Bishops]] and [[Bishop|Archbishops]] still hold these view, the  vast majority of the [[Synod]] have formally reconciled themselves with some [[Asynodal Churches of Iomedae]] through the formulation of the [[Dimmerschluß Creed]], which both the [[Synodal Church of Iomedae]] and as well as the [[Heresy|unheretical]] ascribe to.

With the advent of the [[Nachýrian Exodus]], [[Vahamut]] is commonly worshiped by the [[Kovold|Kobolds]] that have entered the country. 


# Politics
Arcadia is formally ruled by a Queen, often referred to as the Priest-Queen. Arcadia is currently ruled by Priest-Queen [[Mary VIII]]. 

The queen serves a dual purpose. One, she is is the formal chair of the [[Synod]], making her the primarch of the [[Synodal Church of Iomedae]]. In her role as chair she may cast the deciding vote in the case of a 50-50 split in the [[Synod]]. Secondly, she is the (mostly ceremonial) head of state of Arcadia, signing into law all bills passed by the parliament.

While in theory the parliament and the [[Synod]] are distinct entities, there is no shortage of [[Bishop|Bishops]] fulfilling important parliamentary roles even if the [[Bishop|Archbishops]] are formally excluded from these roles.

The feudal system was technically abolished during the [[White Revolution]] in 1737, an act of[[Revelationary Revolution|apocalyptic]] appeasement. These reforms also limited the power of the monarch, and created a strict separation between the entities of the State and the [[Synod]]. 
However, the bishops of the [[Synod]] still hold more than 50% of all privately owned land in [[Arcadia]]. 

Since this time, the only military branch that is still under the direct control of the church is the [[Holy Order of Paladins]], with all other military powers solely controlled by the parliament.
