The Withering Blossoms is a disease that appeared at some time in the mid 1760s, and subsequently led the [[Serpentfolk]] of [[Nachýr]] to extinction. 

While the blossoms also affected [[Lizardfolk]] and to a more minor degree [[Kovold|Kovolds]], it seemingly managed to spread to all [[Serpentfolk]] in the [[Nachýr|Empire]] and by the late 60s, none were left alive 

Many have linked the withering blossoms with the disappearance of [[Tiamat]] and the death of [[Vahamut|Bahamut]], though the direction of the supposed causality is still a mystery. 

The death of the [[Serpentfolk]] and the subsequent political power vacuum are one of the direct causes of the [[Nachýrian Exodus]].

## Symptoms 
The withering blossoms was characterized by the appearence of small crimson flowers growing from tough tree-like twigs from the body of the victom. More and more of these flowers would appear until usually the victim dies of dehyrdration, leaving behind a withered hust. 

While 100% lethal to all [[Serpentfolk]],  even resistant to [[Magic|Magical]] cures, some [[Kovold|Kovolds]] and [[Lizardfolk]] supposedly survived the ordreal, though the patches of flowers do not disappear.
