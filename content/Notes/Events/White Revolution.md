# The White Revolution 
An internal revolution within the [[Synodal Church of Iomedae]] caused by the increased popularity of the [[Asynodal Churches of Iomedae]]. Can be compared to the Counterreformation. It often described as being either a part of, or a reaction to the larger [[Revelationary Revolution]].

The White revolution started with a [[Revelationary Revolution|pro-apocalyptic]] mass protest in [[Covenant]] in 1735. The protest was quelled using secret operands for the [[Holy Order of St. Alia]]. 

After the death of Priest-King [[James IV]] and his succession by Priest-Queen [[Mary VIII]] in 1737, nonetheless, many [[Revelationary Revolution|pro-apocalyptic]] reforms were passed. These actions formally removed the [[Synod]] as the ruling body of [[Arcadia]], replacing it with a parliamentary system. The [[Bishop|Bishops]] with Diocese in [[Arcadia]] proper form a senate which acts a controlling body of government over the parliament. 

The reforms made during the White Revolution also led to the secession of several more conservative church member from [[Las]] and [[Izmoroz]], that united as the [[Sosulkan Churches of Iomedae]], an event often called the [[Secession of '37]]. The remaining [[Arcadia|Arcadian]], [[Polovina|Polovian]]  and [[Lethania|Lethanian]] [[Bishop|Bishops]] have been dubbed the [[Orthodox Synodal Church of Iomedae]].  It was not until 1751 that the western Sosulkan Bishops were formally reinstituted in the [[Synod]] during the [[Reparation of '51]].
