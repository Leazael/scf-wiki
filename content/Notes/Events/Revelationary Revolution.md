The Revelationary, or Apocalyptic, movement was a popular movement that started as a labour movement in 1720s in [[Lethania]] with a series of mass strikes, first in the [[Miasma]] industry and later spreading the the railways. From [[Lethania]] it quickly grew in influence throughout the [[Crucible]] but was often met with government suppression and violence.

The movement called for a radical revelation of the (mainly [[Natural Philosophy|philosophical]] or sometimes [[Magic|Magical]]) secrets held by the upper classes and that they used to stay in power. 

The generally agreed upon start of the revolution took place in [[Sälen]], [[Ilmbund]] during the [[Twelve-Day War]] of 1730, when the halls of the [[Great Guilds of Ilmbund]] were stormed and occupied by an angry mob of citizens. It ended after two of the guilds, the [[Guild of Alchemists]] and the [[Guild of Clockworkers]] agreed to the demands for revelation. The [[Guild of Stonemasons]] however refused and was formally disbanded. A parliament was appointed, with suffrage for al "tax paying citizens."  

The Revolution spread from [[Ilmbund]] back to [[Lethania]], with [[Yrsingen]] the first affected. During the autumn 1731, after many months of violent uprisings, the [[Lethania|Lethanian]] provinces, [[Yrsingen]], [[Hèrlmersc]] and [[Averion]] abolished their aristocratic rule in favour of provincial parliaments. In contrast, [[Væringard]] and [[Fenwald]] united their anti-revelationary aggression and used their army of hussars to quell any uprising within their borders. [[Thurandir]], possibly due to [[Dvårgheim|Dvårgian]] influence, enacted some minor pro-apocalyptic regulations early on, and never experienced an uprising like its neighbouring provinces. Nonetheless, in the aftermath of the [[Great Joust]] of 1740, the Revelationary tensions finally [[Polovina|split]] the [[Lethania|country]] during [[Lethanian War of Separation]].


## [[Asynodal Churches of Iomedae|Asynodal Churches]] and the [[White Revolution]]
In the wake of the revolution, many regions, specially in [[Lethania|South-Lethania]] and [[Ilmbund]] abandoned the traditional [[Synodal Church of Iomedae]] in favour of local congregations with more revelationary inspired readings and  of the [[Iomedaean Canon]]. These churches are now collectively called the [[Asynodal Churches of Iomedae]]. 

Even within the [[Synodal Church of Iomedae|Synodal Church]], Apocalyptic sentiments we felt. In 1735, apocalyptic protesters occupied the central square [[Covenant]] for several weeks, an event also called the [[White Revolution]]. The protest itself was supressed from within by operators from the [[Holy Order of St. Alia]], but still led to many apocalyptic reforms finally instituted in 1737.


## The Warlocks Revolt
The [[Warlock's Revolt]] was a series of riots and marches in the winter of 1729-1730, undertaken by a collection of eccentrics calling themselves [[Wild Magic|Witches and Warlocks]] in the south of [[Lethania]]. 

The participators in the [[Warlock's Revolt|Revolt]] united their forces in the winter of 1730-1731 in an attempt to overthrow the government of [[Hèrlmersc]] in [[Eldmere]], only to find out their powers had disappeared. 

The gathered [[Magic]]-users were quickly and brutallly slaughtered by the government forces. Many of the survivors stayed incarcerated until the autumn 1731, when the governments of the [[Lethania|South-Lethanian]] abdicated.
