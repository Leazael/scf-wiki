A [[Necromancy|necromantic]] event occurring in 1761 in east [[Ilmbund]], caused by the mass-death from thousands of [[Yádor|Yádorian]] invaders dying to the [[Ilmbund|Ilmian]] machine guns. The invasion was possibly in response to the [[Ilmbund|Ilmian]] border expending ever east-ward.

It was stopped in 1762 when the [[Bishop|Bishops]] of the [[Synodal Church of Iomedae]] came to the aid of the [[Asynodal Churches of Iomedae|Asynodal]] priests attempting to intervene.

The collaboration yielded in a formal rapprochement between the [[Asynodal Churches of Iomedae|Asynodal]] and [[Synodal Church of Iomedae]], and the formulation of the [[Dimmerschluß Creed]] adopted by both the [[Orthodox Synodal Church of Iomedae]], [[Sosulkan Churches of Iomedae]] and most [[Ilmbund|Ilmian]] [[Asynodal Churches of Iomedae|Asynodal Churches]].
