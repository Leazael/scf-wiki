# The Facsimile 
One of the most important contributions of [[Natural Philosophy]] is the invention of the facsimile machine. Originally invented in [[Ilmbund]], the classical facsimile-machine is a device, usually one of a pair (though larger groups of machines are sometimes produced as well), that combines a writing stylus with a swath of paper. Whenever the stylus is moved, the stylus of its partner moves in an identical way. Exploiting this mechanism, allows for the nigh-instantaneous transportation of written messages over vast distances, i.e. telegraphy.

In modern times, facsimiles are no longer produced strictly in pairs, but often come with one, or sometimes more, [[Resolite|Resolites]], allowing the machine to select the frequency on which it broadcasts and receives, as long as it is with a machine with a similar or identical [[Resolite]] type.

Different telegraphy companies, allow customers to send messages to almost every corner of the [[Crucible]], making them the preferred way of long-distance communication. In addition to the telegraphy companies, many businesses, governments and private individuals keep facsimile machines.

### Mechanism
Facsimile machines operate by means of [[Anætherial Resonance|Anætheria Harmonic Resonances]]. The operating resonance can be set by adjusting the [[Resolite]] of the machine, broadcasting the [[Resolite|Resolite’s]] vibrations to all machines with a compatible [[Resolite|harmony]] that are set to the same frequency.

Since broadcasts can be intercepted by anyone who has access to the right [[Resolite]] and frequency, messages are often encrypted. However, some rogue philosophers, often called [[Hitcher|Hitchers]] have found ways to hitch on to the Facsimile network with powerful [[Ordinator|Ordinators]] in order to hijack facsimile traffic.

### Production
The production of facsimile machines is aninterdisciplinary endeavour. Most facsimile-machines and their components are still produced in [[Ilmbund]], with the mechanics being provided by members of the [[Guild of Clockworkers]] and the [[Resolite|Resolites]] being produced by the [[Guild of Alchemists]]. It should be noted that in fact most of the large telegraphy networks are maintained by the [[Guild of Bankers and Brokers]].

### Variations
In the last decade, [[Natural Philosophy|philosophers]] have discovered the means of not just sending stylus-movement, but sound messages as well, resulting in two increasingly common devices known as the [[Sonofax]], or the Sax (essentially a radio) and the [[Vocofax]] or the Vox (Essentially a telephone).
