An Ordinator is complicated clockwork device, capable of arbitrary acts of computation, modifying its meta-clockwork through the use of punch-cards. People who write these instructions, often for a living, are referred to as meta-clockworkers, or [[Meta|Metas]].

Small modern Ordinators are usually not much larger than a sewing machine, and may include a small [[Miasma]] generator to supply the power needed to operate the internal gearwork. 

Some modern Ordinators use [[Electricity|Electrical]] components in conjunction with its more central clockwork components. While such Ordinators can be faster than regular purely mechanical Ordinators, they require more maintenance. Additionally, sufficiently complex [[Electricity|Electrical]] components tend to attract [[Gremlin|Gremlins]].

A [[Black Box]] is a particular type of Ordinator, designed to perform automatous functions.
