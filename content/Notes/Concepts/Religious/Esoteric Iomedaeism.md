Esoteric Iomedeaism is an approach to the worship op [[Iomedae]] that focuses less on the core dogma and tenets of the [[Church of Iomedae]], and more on secret, hidden or arcane traditions and mysteries that surround the faith.

The various canonical, and deuterocanonical [[Saint|Saints]], as well as the invocation of [[Angel|Angels]] feature heavily in these secret traditions.

Scholars of [[Natural Philosophy]], and in particular those studying [[Hermetic Philosophy]] are usually involved in at least some level of Esoteric Iomedaeism. The various [[Great Guilds of Ilmbund|Great Guild]] and before their dissolution, the [[Guild of Stonemasons]], are known to perform rituals steeped in Esoteric Iomedaeism.

It should be noted that the [[Synodal Church of Iomedae|Synodal Church]] does not have a formal stance on the practice of Eosteric Iomedaeism. It is generally agreed that the practice does not necessarily conflict with the beliefs stated in the [[Dimmerschlu√ü Creed]].  

Several [[Asynodal Churches of Iomedae|Asynodal Churches]] have disavowed any form of Esoteric practice, on the basis that it violates the [[Six Tenets|Fith Tenet]].
