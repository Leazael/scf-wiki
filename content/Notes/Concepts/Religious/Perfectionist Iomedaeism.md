# Perfectionsist Iomedaesim
(Perfectionistisch Iomedaeisme)

A [[Heresy]] practiced by some members of the [[Asynodal Churches of Iomedae]]. The core tenet is that [[Iomedae]] is perfect in her divinity, and has shed her mortal fallibilities during her apotheosis. This is in contrast with the [[Dimmerschlu√ü Creed]], which states that [[Iomedae]] contains within her both mortal and divine aspects, and, as mortals cannot comprehend divinity, she can only interact with mortals through her own mortality, and hence imperfectly.

Followers of Perfectionist Iomedaeism, see [[Iomedae]] as an all-seeing, all-benevolent goddess who is able to intervene in the lives of the righteous. A derived belief is that suffering is something that people bring upon themselves and since no human is perfect, no human may be free of suffering. Followers of this [[Heresy]] may undertake mortification of the flesh.

Perfectionist is separate from, but often overlaps with, [[Symbolic Iomedaeism]].
