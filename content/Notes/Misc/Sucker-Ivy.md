# Sucker-Ivy
Sucker-Ivy is a type of carnivorous ivy that mainly grows on the [[Walls of Elbisborg]]. While regular ivy cannot attach itself to the [[Walls of Elbisborg|walls]] (because of its apparent immunity to most glues and similar substances), sucker-ivy has evolved (or was developed) with a small network of persistent suckers that can attach themselves to these walls.

It is theorized that sucker-ivy was the result of [[Alchemy|Alchemical]] meddling with regular ivy, and may have been altered from regular ivy by the same mechanism that the [[Altpox]] applied to sapient species and animals.

Sucker-Ivy is known to occasionally trap birds and other small animals within its vines, and to consume these for nutrients.
