Giants are a collection for several races of large humanoids. Depending on their origins, they stand between 10 and 20 ft. tall, and can look anything from monstrous to ordinary, by human standards.

It is said a race of human-like Giants can be found in the [[Thurmork]] forest, in the north of [[Dvårgheim]] and some individuals have even found their home in the subterranean cities of [[Førnheller]] and [[Draumdyr]].

Nomadic fur-covered giants can be found wandering the planes of [[Nichija-Zembla]]. [[Voyvetera]]. Large horned giants are said to be used as workers in [[Urrun]].
