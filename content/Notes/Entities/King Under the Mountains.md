The King under the Mountains is a mysterious being, that lives deep beneath the caverns of [[Førnheller]] in [[Dvårgheim]]. Some claim it is a dragon or a golem, but others say it is something much older and more cunning.

The being must be defeated in order to be eligible to become the High King of [[Dvårgheim]], though any aspirants can still be blocked by the [[Dvårgheim|Dvårgian]] Senate.
