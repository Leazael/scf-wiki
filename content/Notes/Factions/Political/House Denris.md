One of the [[Great Joust|Great Houses]] of [[Lethania]] before the [[Lethanian War of Separation]]. They used to be the ruling family of [[Fenwald]], ruling the province from the city of [[Görmerstein]].

After the war, the family merged with [[House Bern]] to form the joint [[House of Denris-Bern]], the ruling family of [[Polovina]], of which [[Grand-Duchess Adelheid Denris-Bern]] is its most influential member. 

They are known for keeping and riding direwolves, which may have originally come from [[Nichija-Zembla]].
