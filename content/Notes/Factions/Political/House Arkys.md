One of the [[Great Joust|Great Houses]] of [[Lethania]] before the [[Lethanian War of Separation]]. They used to be the ruling family of [[Hèrlmersc]], operating from the capital [[Eldmere]]. 

They are still one of the richest families in [[Lethania]], due to their early investments in the [[Miasma]] enterprises in that region. They hold a relevant percentage of the shares of [[LoeterCo]] and played a large role in [[Lethanian Colonies|colonizing]] [[Nachýr]], giving their name to the colony-city [[Fort Arkys]].

The family is known for keeping and riding Hèrldraecs, large Iguana-like creatures that can run across water.
