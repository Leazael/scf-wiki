# The Asynodal Churches of Iomedae

For most of the history of the church, there have been individual churches that did not stay in touch with the [[Synod]]. These churches were originally hunted down by the [[Inquisition]], however, since the [[Revelationary Revolution]] more and more churches separated themselves from the [[Synod]]. 

The Asynodal church is by far the largest branch in both [[Ilmbund]] and [[Lethania]], though individual Asynodal Churches can be found throughout the [[Crucible]]. [[Polovina]] has actively outlawed all Asynodal Churches that do not abide by the [[Dimmerschluß Creed]].

It should be noted that the [[Halfling|Halflings]] of the [[Crucible]] have invented their own gospel-like style of worshipping [[Iomedae]] outside the confines of the [[Synodal Church of Iomedae]]. The most well-known typical [[Halfling]] tradition is the Revival. This mass-like event is usually held outdoors or in a tent, and is led by a, usually unsanctioned, preacher. During such Revivals, lively music is played, scenes from the [[Three Lays]] and [[Nine Parables]] are preenacted and sometimes even miracles are performed.

The [[Asynodal Churches of Iomedae]] can be split into two branches, namely by those who do, and do not abide by the [[Dimmerschluß Creed]]. 

Some Asynodal churches have developed ideas and doctrine that varies wildly from the teachings of churches that abide by the [[Dimmerschluß Creed]]. Members of these churches sometimes distinguish themselves by wearing the [[Star of Iomedae]] sideways. Some of these ideas are even considered [[Heresy]] by the Creed-abiding churches.
