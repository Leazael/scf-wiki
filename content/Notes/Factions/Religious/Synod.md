The Synod is the name for the council of [[Bishop|Bishops]] that governs the [[Synodal Church of Iomedae]]. It is responsible for selecting the [[Synodal Church of Iomedae|Synodal Church's]] poclicies and has the final word on matters related to dogma and the interpretation of the [[Iomedaean Canon]].

The Synod consists of 24 [[Bishop|Bishops]] from the [[Orthodox Synodal Church of Iomedae]] and 24 [[Bishop|Bishops]] from the [[Sosulkan Churches of Iomedae]]. The council is chaired by Priest-Queen [[Mary VIII]] in her role as [[Bishop|Archbishop]] of [[Covenant]], who is also the formal representative of the [[Synodal Church of Iomedae|Synodal Church]]. She also casts the deciding vote in the case of a rare 24-24 split. During sessions, [[Celestial]] is spoken.

The physical council is located in the [[Arcadia|Arcadian]] city of [[Covenant]]. Except for rare circumstances, the [[Bishop|Bishops]] of the Synod are rarely physically present at the council. Instead, these [[Bishop|Bishops]] are represented by their [[Os|Ora]], who vote on their behalf.

While the [[Synod]] used to rule most of [[Arcadia]], its temporal powers were limited in the wake of the [[White Revolution]].

The Synod oversees all of the institutions tied to the [[Synodal Church of Iomedae|Synodal Church]], such as
- The [[Seminary of Aldsbury]]
- The [[Inquisition]]
- The [[Holy Order of Paladins]]
- The [[Holy Order of St. Alia]]
- The [[Prophetic Choir of St. Omelas]]
and many others.
