aliases: [St. Alia, The Knife Saint, The Black Saint]

One of the original [[Twelve Paladins]] who assaulted the Heavens together with [[Iomedae]] during the [[Rupture of the Ã†ther]].

From the brief hints given in the [[Iomedaean Canon]], St. Alia may have been a darker figure, who specialized in subterfuge and may even have been an assassin of some kind before the raid on the heavens with the other [[Twelve Paladins]].

The infamous [[Holy Order of St. Alia]] is named after this mysterious [[Saint]].
