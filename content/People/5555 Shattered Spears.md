5555-Shattered-Spears, or Dárgis'dárvin'dársæn'dárzulgrváks, also is a [[Kovold|Koboldic]] wandering saint-fool-hero figure. Their stories often involve them encountering some incident during their travels, often involving highly placed [[Nachýr|Nachýrian]] authority figures such as [[Lizardfolk|Kozarn]] or [[Serpentfolk]], and correcting their behaviour or thought by means of his mystical insights. 

It should be noted that "5555" itself is not a literal translation, but based on a mathematical error. As [[Draconic]] uses a base-6 number system, a more literal translation would be 1295 (or 5555₆) Shattered Spears.

As is often the case in [[Kovold|Kovoldic]] oral traditions, they are, even within the same story, often addressed by many different names:
- Dárgis'dárvin'dársæn'dárzulgrváks, translated as 5555 Shattered Spears.
- Kynrkém'ruk'zulgrváks, translated as 10000 - 1 Shattered Spears.
- Chykánthrváks, translated as "a number of un-spears".

Some scholars have hypothesized that they may be a local variant of [[Skyplotec the Wanderer]].
