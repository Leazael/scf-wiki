Geirvaldr Skyhammer is the current High King of [[Dvårgheim]]. A Dwarf, sometime in the early 1500s, he defeated the [[King Under the Mountains]] in 1691 AF, after which the previous High King abdicated in Geirvaldr's favour. He is currently the third longest reigning High King in the history of [[Dvårgheim]].

Early in his reign, he quickly gained the favour from [[Polovina|Lethania]] (before its split into north and south), by cracking down on the raiders that frequently plagued the northern coasts. This broke the longstanding [[Dvårgheim|Dvårgian]] tradition of isolationism that the country had maintained for many centuries.

Under Geirvaldr's rule, [[Dvårgheim]] has managed to claim a reputation as one the [[Philosophical Powers]] of the [[Crucible]]. His rulings have tended on the progressive side, and while it stayed neutral during the [[Lethanian War of Separation]], he has convinced the [[Dvårgheim|Dvårgian]] senate to adopted several [[Revelationary Revolution|Apocalyptic]] policies, even before the onset of the [[Revelationary Revolution|Apocalyptic Revolution]].

During his reign, there have been only two aspiring contesters to the throne, but each was turned down by the senate, despite their conquering of the [[King Under the Mountains]].
