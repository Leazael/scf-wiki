Elhandrur the Inane was an apocryphal High-King of [[Dv√•rgheim]], most notable for supposedly being the only [[Elf]] to ever claim the throne.

This supposedly happened in 1141 AF, in the aftermath of the millennial celebration of the founding of the country. Having bested the [[King Under the Mountains]] in secret, he was elected while the Senate was supposedly too drunk to notice that the aspiring king was an elf. 

He passed several laws that extended the celebration of the millennial anniversary, supposedly outlawing soberness itself. He either abdicated or vanished after one month of continuous inebriation. 

Some have speculated that Elhandrur may have been an avatar or prophet of [[Skyplotec the Wanderer]].
