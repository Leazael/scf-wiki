Váida Khan was the [[Halfling]] war-leader of the [[Yádor|Yádorian]] people during the great [[Yádor|Yádorian]] invasion of 1585 AF.

During this invasion, she led a great horde of [[Human|Humans]] and [[Halfling|Halflings]] through the gap between the [[Göllnyr Mountains|Göllnyr]] and the [[Wavering Mountains]]. The raiders managed to penetrate deep into [[Ilmbund|Ilmian]] territory. 

Through a joint effort of [[Ilmbund|Ilmian]], [[Arcadia|Arcadian]] and [[Lethania|Lethanian]], the raiders were finally pushed back in the summer of 1586 AF. 

At the [[Treaty of Ölmfurt]] it was decided that henceforth, each of these countries would supply part of a standing army, meant to keep the [[Yádor|Yádorians]] from invading by force. Stationed at the newly erected fortress at [[Raubmaul]], these forces protected the west, up until the events of the [[Thanatogenic Ghost Storm]] almost 200 years alter.

Some popular tails tell that Váida Khan and her daughters supposedly "stole the seed" of many [[Ilmbund|Ilmian]] nobleman.
