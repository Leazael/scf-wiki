The week can be divided into seven days, mainly named after the [[Æsir]], even in countries where the worship of [[Iomedae]] is more common.
1. Moonday, Maandag
2. Tyrsday, Dingdag
3. Midweek/Odinsday, Midweek
4. Thorsday, Thorsdag
5. Freysday, Freisdag
6. Sun's Eve, Zonavond
7. Sunday, Zondag

Each year can also be divided into four seasons, namely winter, spring, summer and autumn. While days are long in the summer and short in the winter, a quirk of astronomy can be seen during other seasons. In the autumn, the sun rises extremely quickly, rising to its highest point in the first few hours of the day, after which it sets extremely slowly. Conversely, in the spring, dawn breaks slowly, while sunset lasts only moments. This effect is at its strongest on the equinoxes (i.e. on the last days of the Month of Grass and the Month of Wine).

This calendar or a variant thereof has been adopted by all lands in and surrounding the [[Crucible]] with the notable exception of [[Vareshian Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] of [[Tel Varesh]] and [[Nachýr]].

The weekdays are used by the [[Anglic]], [[Dvårgish]] and [[Ildarin]] speaking countries ([[Arcadia]], [[Dvårgheim]], [[Lethania]], [[Polovina]], [[Ilmbund]]). 

The [[Sosulkan]] speaking countries [[Las]] and [[Izmoroz]], as well as [[Tel Varesh]] keep their own caladers and weekdays.
