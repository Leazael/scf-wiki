# The Peace of Weißenfels
The Peace of [[Weißenfels]], is the name for the peace treaty that formally ended the [[Lethanian War of Separation]] (1742 - 1745) between the [[Corridor]], i.e., [[Lethania|South-Lethania]] and [[Ilmbund]]; and the [[Allied Forces]], i.e., [[Polovina|North-Ilmbubd]] and [[Arcadia]].

The direct cause for the end of the war was the final [[Cacotopic Warp]] of [[Holmgard]], which was at the time still the capital of the old [[Lethania|Lethanian]] Confederacy. With the end of the war, all sides decided to lay down arms and negotiate a peace.

As part of the treaty, the provinces of [[Hèrlmersc]] and [[Yrsingen]], together with large parts of [[Thurandir]] and [[Averion]] were united to form the new [[Revelationary Revolution|Revelationary]] People's Republic of South-[[Lethania]] . Likewise, the provinces of [[Fenwald]] and [[Væringard]], together with parts of [[Thurandir]] were united to form the newly made [[Polovina|Grand Duchy of Polovina]]. Finally, eastern-[[Averion]] chose to re-join [[Arcadia]].

[[Dvårgheim]] was officially an observer state during the signing of the treaty.
