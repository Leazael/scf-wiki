Since the establishment of Las, relative prosperity reigned in the [[Crucible]]. Especially [[Nachýr]] started trading more and more with its neighbours. It was because of this contact that also the worship of [[Tiamat]], the Dragon-Queen of [[Nachýr]] was slowly starting to spread out towards neighbouring countries. This provoked the established [[Church of Iomedae]] in [[Arcadia]] to the point that in 822 AF the First [[Crusade]] was launched. 

Hellbent on destroying [[Tiamat]] and all her followers, King [[Richaerd II]] of [[Arcadia]] set out with over a hundred thousand men and women in order to drive back the [[Nachýr|Dragon Empire]] from whence it came.

Although the [[Arcadia|Arcadian]] forces suffered some heavy losses and were ultimately unsuccessful in destroying the [[Nachýr|Empire]], they did manage to put an end to the constant advancement of the [[Nachýr|Empire’s]] borders. In 831 AF the remaining armies of Arcadia returned home, now led by [[Richaerd II|Richaerd II’s]] only surviving son, [[Henry II]].

Almost two hundred years after the first [[Crusade]], [[Tiamat]] decided that an end should be put to [[Arcadia|Arcadia’s]] arrogance and in 1017 AF the Counter Crusade was launched, a conflict that would last until 1021 AF. Not only did Tiamat march in force upon [[Arcadia]], she also personally laid waste to many of [[Arcadia|Arcadia’s]] most crucial allies, most notably during the [[Sack of Ilm's Watch]] in the winter of 1018 AF.

Over the next four hundred years, [[Arcadia]] would try two more times to destroy [[Tiamat]], launching two new crusades, one from 1199 AF to 1211 AF and one from 1416 AF to 1424 AF.
