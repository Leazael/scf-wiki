The Elven Genocide of 1564 AF is the singular event resonsible for the disappearance of the [[Elf|Elves]]. 

Before the genocide, the [[Elf|elves]] lived in a time of great prosperity, mostly on the elven homeworld of [[Cinis|Eldedeël]], and were at, what some would argue, the height of their civilization.

This all changed when the Ambassador to the [[Shining Academy]] decided to forcefully impress himself upon the youngest of the elven princesses. When this reached the king's ears, he had the [[Bondsmage]] tortured to death, in defiance of the [[Blood Oath|Sanguine Promise]]. The [[Bondsmage|Bondsmag]] demanded that the king would turn himself over to the [[Shining Academy]], in response to which the king declared war upon the Academy.

Hundreds of thousands of elven soldiers marched upon slightly less than one thousand [[Bondsmage|Bondsmag]]. In the resulting battles nearly four hundred thousand elves lost their lives, as did over a dozen [[Bondsmage|Bondsmag]]. The [[Bondsmage|Bondsmag]] responded by exterminating every kinsmember of every soldier that brought down a [[Bondsmage]]. 

After the completion of their Genocide, less than a tenth of the elven race survived and their homeworld burnt as a torch in the heavens of all the other worlds. The remaining elves, brought down low by the holocaust, were forced to seek an alliance with their ancient enemy: the [[Grey Elf|Grey Elves]]. Together these races joined and founded their new homeworld, [[Elsar]]. Their old homeworld in most tongues now bears the name [[Cinis]], “Ashes”.
