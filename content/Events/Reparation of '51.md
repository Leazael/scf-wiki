The reuinification of the [[Sosulkan Churches of Iomedae]] with the [[Orthodox Synodal Church of Iomedae]] to form again the [[Synodal Church of Iomedae]]. It happened in the wake of the death of [[Koschei the Deathless]] and his sucession by [[Ivan I Czarovitch]].

After the death of Priest-King [[James IV]] and his succession by Priest-Queen [[Mary VIII]] in 1737, many pro-apocalyptic reforms were passed. Unfortunately, these reforms led to the secession of several more conservative church member from [[Las]] and [[Lizardfolk]], that united as the [[Sosulkan Churches of Iomedae]], an event often called the [[Secession of '37]]. 

The remaining [[Arcadia|Arcadian]], [[Polovina|Polovian]]  and [[Lethania|Lethanian]] [[Bishop|Bishops]] have been dubbed the [[Orthodox Synodal Church of Iomedae]].  It was not until 1751 that the western Sosulkan Bishops were formally reinstituted in the [[Synod]] during the [[Reparation of '51]].
