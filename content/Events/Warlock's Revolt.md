The [[Warlock's Revolt]] was a series of riots and marches in the winter of 1729-1730, undertaken by a collection of eccentrics calling themselves [[Wild Magic|Witches and Warlocks]] in the south of [[Lethania]]. It famously collapsed disastrously, at some point during the [[Revelationary Revolution|Apocalyptic Revolution]].

# Prelude
The rebels started out as separate bands of protestors, marching from town to town and gathering a small army of [[Magic]] users in their wake. Despite the fact that these rebels were heavily persecuted by the [[Revelationary Revolution|Apocalyptic]] movement for harbouring [[Magic|Arcane Secrets]], they still claimed to support Apocalyptic ideals, and had the intent reveal the workings of their [[Ways and Means|craft]]. 

Early on, they provided effective resistance to both the original government suppression of the [[Revelationary Revolution|Apocalyptic]] movement, as well as dissenting voices from within the movement itself. 


# The Revolt
When the different organized bands of witches united near [[Eldmere]] in the winter of 1730-1731 in an attempt to overthrow the government of [[HÃ¨rlmersc]], tragedy struck when many of the participating [[Wild Magic|Witches and Warlocks]] discovered that their powers had disappeared. 

The gathered [[Magic]]-users were quickly and brutally slaughtered by the government forces. Many of the survivors stayed incarcerated until the autumn 1731, when the governments of the [[Lethania|South-Lethania]] abdicated.

Over the years, many reasons have been given for the famous failure of Revolt. Popular theories include the medelling of counter-[[Revelationary Revolution|Apocalyptic]] [[Wild Magic|Witches]] from the [[Polovina|North]], strange magic-eating diseases or even meddling by the [[Fair Folk]].

Many of the earliest [[Natural Philosophy|Philosophers]] that laid the ground work for what would become [[Hermetic Philosophy]] were participants in the Warlock's Revolt. Notably Professor [[Arora van Finsterling|A.L. van Finsterling]], who founded the department of [[Hermetic Philosophy]] at the [[College of Elbisborg]] participated in her late teenage years.
