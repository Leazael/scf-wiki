The War of Frozen Chains was a war conducted between [[Nachýr]] and [[Izmoroz]], that lasted from 566 AF until 581 AF. 

The war was triggered by the continuous expansion of [[Nachýr]]'s borders under the command of [[Tiamat]], especially in the regions south of the [[Nemedian Mountains]]. 

While the forces of [[Tiamat]] incurred by far the greater losses, [[Koschei the Deathless|Czar Koschei]] failed to significantly push back the encroaching [[Nachýr|Nachýrian]] borders. Nonetheless, the war effectively halted the further expansion of the [[Nachýr|Empire]].

The war got its name from the accounts of the battlefields, littered with the frozen corpses of [[Tiamat|Tiamat’s]] slave soldiers. 

In the aftermath of the war, [[Tiamat]] moved her capital to the newly conquered eastern lands, to the newly conquered city of [[Chýrusandr]].
