The Rime Sea (Rijmzee) is a cold sea to the north of the [[Crucible]]. It extends form the northern coasts of the [[Crucible]] all the way to the north-pole and beyond. 

The sea itself connects the coasts of [[Voyvetera]], [[Izmoroz]], [[Las]], [[Polovina]], [[Dvårgheim]], [[Thrjoskarland]] and [[Nichija-Zembla]]. The Rime Seas is connected to the [[Muspellzee]] and [[Lokastunga]],  and is connected to the [[Widdersin Ocean]] through the [[Strait of Drakul]].

For many centuries, the Rime Sea was the hunting grounds of the [[Human]] raiders from the coasts of [[Dvårgheim]], and used to plague cities and villages in what is now known as [[Polovina]] and [[Las]]. However, the rapid [[Natural Philosophy|Philosophical]] developments within [[Polovina]] have led these raids to being massively outgunned. Hence such raids have not occurred for well over a century.

In recent years, powerful the Rime Sea has seen more traffic, especially between [[Tel Varesh]] and the northern [[Philosophical Powers]].
