The Myrk is the name of a river flowing from [[Ilmbund]] through [[Arcadia]]. It passes the cities of [[Aldsbury]] and [[Innsmyrk]]. It is also commonly used as the name for the swamps in the delta of this river, bordering on the [[Dimmerwold]].

The Myrk swamp is a relatively newly discovered source of precious [[Miasma]], making it the only known large source next to the [[HÃ¨rlmersc]]. 

On its discovery, the Myrk swamp was jointly exploited by the two [[Philosophical Powers]], however, tensions due to strikes and price-negotiations were one of the major factors in the conflict leading up to the [[Silent War]] (1756 - 1758).
