Elsar is the home-[[Planet]] of the [[Grey Elf|Grey Elves]] since the [[Rupture of the Ã†ther]].

While originally [[Elf|High Elves]] were forbidden from setting foot on Elsar's soil, in in the wake of the [[Elven Genocide]] and the burning of [[Cinis]], many [[Elf|High Elves]] now call Elsar their home.
