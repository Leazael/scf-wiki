Ruïn is a place not usually mentioned in polite conversation. Even the mere mentioning of the place is considered by most to be unlucky. The few reports that do exist of the country describe great circles of standing stones, large menhirs and obelisks, fallen arches and scattered ruins.

It is common knowledge that the shadows of Ruïn are inhabited by monsters, though it is said that some tribes of cursed people live among its standing stones.

Some claim that the [[Torque|forces]] behind the [[Cacotopic Warp]] are the same ones that haunt this blighted land.
