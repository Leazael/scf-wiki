The Æthermills are mysterious crystalline towers that dot the landscape of [[Hèrlmersc]]. The towers stand between 20 and 90 meters tall, and range in colour from grey-blue to dark amethyst. 

They are in all likelihood made of a material similar to the [[Walls of Elbisborg]], and cannot be scratched, damaged or altered by mundane means. Nonetheless, some of the towers look damage, crumbled of broken.

Though the "mills" have no blades, occasionally, a roughly circular distortion in the air can be seen near the top op these towers, generally pointed in a roughly southern direction. 

Popular [[Natural Philosophy|Philosophy]] has it the towers somehow harness power from the [[Luminiferous Æther|Æther]], though no serious research backs this.
