Tel Varesh is a large city west of the [[Crucible]] and [[Izmoroz]], and the the de facto capitol of the [[Vareshian Commonwealth]]. In the [[Crucible|east]],  The name Tel Varesh is often used as a pars pro toto for the entire [[Vareshian Commonwealth|Commonwealth]].

The city is build on a series of islands within the Vareshian Lagoon, a natural harbour on the coast of  the [[Widdersin Ocean]]. Notably, its inner city is constructed from white marble and dark granites, and is known for the hundreds of bridges, canals, connecting the many islands and separating the neighbourhoods.

The city is mainly inhabited by [[Ork|Orks]], though with a sizeable minority of [[Human|Humans]] and [[Halfling|Hobgoblins]] as well. The city also houses many animals that are considered strange or exotic in the [[Crucible|east]], such as the notorious [[Blood Moth|Blood Moths]], who prey upon unsuspecting sleepers; the [[Carrion Squid]] who will swarm any fool stupid enough to swim in the canals while bleeding; and the [[Death's Head Monkey|Death's Head Monkeys]] frequently employed as messengers by those who can afford them,

The city, like the rest of the [[Vareshian Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] still has a strong magical tradition, which they refer to as [[Thaumaturgy]], due to its symbiotic ties with the [[Bondsmage|Bondsmagi]] of the [[Shining Academy]]. This art is taught at the [[Exalted School of Tel Varesh]].

Its rulers are elected by a council of representatives chosen by lottery, who are advised by the [[Masked Priests]] of the [[Primal Ancestors]].
