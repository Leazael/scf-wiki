aliases: [Sack of Ilm's Watch]

Ilm's watch was once the largest city in the [[Crucible]], located at the forking of the [[Thryr]] halfway between [[Wei√üenfels]] and [[Elbisborg]], and supposedly originated on the [[Previous World]].

The city was destroyed after it was sacked by [[Tiamat]] herself in the winter of 1018 AF, at the height of the [[Crusade|Counter Crusade]].

The city has given its name to the [[Ilmbund]] and [[Ilmbund|Ilmian]] culture in general.
