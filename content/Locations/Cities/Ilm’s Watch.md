[[Crucible]]

[[Crusade]]

Almost two hundred years after the first crusade, Tia-
mat decided that an end should be put to [[Arcadia|Arcadia’s]]
arrogance and in 1017 AF the Counter Crusade was
launched, a conflict that would last until 1021 AF. Not
only did Tiamat march in force upon Arcadia, she also
personally laid waste to many of Arcadia’s most crucial
allies, most notably during the [[Sack of Ilm's Watch]] in
the winter of 1018 AF.
