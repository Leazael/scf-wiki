# Ornsheill
Ornsheill is the former capital city of the [[Lethania|Lethanian]] province of [[VÃ¦ringard]]. The city was largely destroyed in bombing-raids during the [[Lethanian War of Separation]] (1742 - 1745). After the war, it became part of the newly founded [[Polovina|Grand Duchy of Polovina]].

After the war, the city quickly thrived again, due to its position as the last major train-station before the [[Fomorian Mountains]], and [[Sosulka]], in [[Izmoroz]], beyond.

Ornsheill is the ancestral city of the [[House Bern|Bern Familiy]].
