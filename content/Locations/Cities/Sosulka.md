# Sosulka
Sosulka is the modern day capital of [[Izmoroz]] and the seat of Czar [[Ivan I Czarovitch]]. 

Sosulka one of the oldest cities of the [[Crucible]], predating [[Izmoroz]] itself by many centuries, and hailing quite possibly from the [[Previous World]].  As such, the city is the origin of much of the culture of [[Izmoroz]] and [[Las]], and has even given its name to the most common tongue of that region: [[Sosulkan]].

Despite the [[Sosulkan Churches of Iomedae]] having a near-spiritual monopoly in the city, Sosulka still houses one of the only temples of the [[Old Sosulkan Gods]].

The city housed one of the embassies of the [[Shining Academy]], until it closed its doors in 1726.
