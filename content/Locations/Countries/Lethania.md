# Lethania 
(De Geopenbaarde Volksrepubliek van Zuid-Lethanië)
The [[Revelationary Revolution|Revelationary]] People's Republic of South-Lethania
formerly the Lethanian Confederacy.

The founding of [[Lethania]] as the year zero in the [[Calendar]] of the [[Crucible]].

### Summary
Lethania consists of the former (greater) Lethanian provinces of [[Hèrlmersc]] and [[Yrsingen]] as well as sizable parts of [[Averion]] and [[Thurandir]], later expanded with the majority of the [[Step-Stone Isles]]. It also possesses several colonies on the southern part of the [[Nachýr|Nachýrian]] subcontinent. 

The capital of Lethania is [[Eldmere]]. The primary language of Lethania is [[Ildarin]]. It is considered one of the [[Philosophical Powers]]. 

Lethania and [[Polovina]] used to be part of the Lethanian Confederacy, but have split since the [[Lethanian War of Separation]], during which it allied with [[Ilmbund]] against the [[Arcadia|Arcadian]] supported [[Polovina]]. Its former capital, [[Holmgard]] was effectively destroyed during the [[Cacotopic Warp]]. (1745)

Lethania shares a border with [[Nachýr]], [[Dalriada]], [[Izmoroz]], [[Polovina]], [[Dvårgheim]], [[Ilmbund]] and [[Arcadia]]. It has a sizable [[Lethanian Colonies|colonies]] in the south of [[Nachýr]], specifically around the cities of [[New Holmgard]] and [[Fort Arkys]]. 

Lethania is home to one of the most respected [[University|Universities]] in the [[Crucible]], namely the [[Academy of Weißenfels]], located in [[Weißenfels]], [[Yrsingen]].

### History
Lethania was founded in 0 AF, in the city of Lethan, later called [[Holmgard]] by a group of families who desired to unite against the encroaching borders of [[Izmoroz]] and the armies of [[Koschei the Deathless]], as well as against the [[Yádor|Yádorian]] Hordest to the east.

Over the next few centuries, the [[Lethania|Lethanian]] Lords carved out a large swath of territory between the [[Rime Sea]] and the [[Wilted Ocean]], east of the [[Fomorian Mountains]]. 

In 697 AF, Lethania suffered much during the [[Year Without Dawn]]. In the aftermath, they found themselves the neighbours of the newly formed country of [[Las]].

In 1585 - 1586, Lethania aided the other countries of the [[Crucible]] in staving of the invading [[Yádor|Yádorian]] hordes, and became one of the signatories at the [[Treaty of Ölmfurt]].

In 1656 AF, against the wishes and wisdom of [[Lethania]] and Ilmbund, Arcadia launched its fourth, and to this date final [[Crusade]]. After a seven year long [[Crusade]] and the siege of [[Lgárnach]], which lasted three years, it was decided by [[Lethania]] and [[Ilmbund]] that this [[Crusade]] should come to an end. They rallied their forces against those of [[Arcadia]] and slowly drove the [[Arcadia|Arcadian]] armies back from [[Nachýr]] towards [[Arcadia]]. In addition, it was decided that a large part of [[Arcadia|Arcadian]] territory would be transferred to Lethania, as an independent province, ruled by a more peaceful branch of the Arcadian royal family. Thus it was in the year 1663 that the fourth [[Crusade]] ended, and that the Province of [[Averion]] became a part of Lethanian Confederacy. 

Despite the [[Crusade|Crusades]] having formally ended, [[Arcadia]] still remained engrossed in a border conflict with [[Nachýr]] on the [[Step-Stone Isles]]. In 1729, Lethania, fed up again, intervened. A peace was again forced between [[Arcadia]] and [[Nachýr]], and a large part of the [[Step-Stone Isles]] became Lethanian territory.

In 1731 the [[Revelationary Revolution]] that had broken out in [[Ilmbund]] the year before, reached the Lethanian province of [[Yrsingen]]. Under these new [[Revelationary Revolution|apocalyptic]] influences, the provinces [[Yrsingen]], [[Averion]] and [[Hèrlmersc]], as well as the capitol city of [[Holmgard]] quickly started democratizing. Furthermore, both [[Yrsingen]] and [[Hèrlmersc]] started rejecting the [[Synodal Church of Iomedae]] in favour of the newly founded [[Asynodal Churches of Iomedae]].

In 1741, the winner of the [[Great Joust]], [[Vladimir Denris]] of [[Fenwald]] tried to revert  some of the [[Revelationary Revolution|apocalyptic]] changes the south had instituted. This was, however, met with fierce resistance resulting in the [[Lethanian War of Separation]].

In 1745 the war abruptly ends when [[Holmgard]] [[Cacotopic Warp|Pivots]] again, this time permanently. With the loss of these millions of lives, all sides lay down their arms and the war ends with the signing of the [[Peace of Weißenfels]]. The southern Provinces [[Hèrlmersc]], [[Yrsingen]], as well as West-[[Averion]] and east [[Thurandir]] together form the  [[Revelationary Revolution|Revelationary]] People's Republic of South-Lethania, while the remaining northern provinces form the [[Polovina|Grand Duchy of Polovina]]. East-[[Averion]] re-joins [[Arcadia]].

In 1749, [[Lethania]] tries to strengthen its war-damaged economy by formally acknowledging the [[Lethanian Colonies]] in [[Nachýr]] and officially buys the land surrounding the newly founded city [[New Holmgard]] and [[Fort Arkys]] from [[Tiamat]].

In the following years, due to the increased traffic between Lethania and its [[Lethanian Colonies|colonies]], Lethania first encounters the countries [[Murænia]], as wel as the [[Vareshian Commonwealth]]. 

Seemingly unprovoked, the [[Murænai]] take offence to the existence of the Lethanian vessels in the [[Tagelsea]], and in the winter of 1754, the [[Murænai]] attack the Lethanian Capitol of [[Eldmere]], in an event called the [[Massacre of Eldmere]]. In response to the tens-of-thousands of dead, Lethania joins forces with [[Tel Varesh]], who open their first embassy in [[Eldmere]] in the same year. 

Over the years, Lethania nad [[Tel Varesh]] would launc several [[Lethanian-Vareshian Expeditions]] in the hopes of eleminating the [[Murænia|Murænian]] threat. In 1764, they officially end their joint expiditions, though the countries remain allies.

In 1769, the [[Nachýrian Exodus]] starts, and immediately overwhelms the [[Nachýr|Nachýrian]]-[[Lethania|Lethanian]] border.

### Races
The population of the Lethania consists for the most part of [[Human|Humans]]. Since the [[Nachýrian Exodus]] in 1769 a sizable minority of [[Kovold|Kobolds]] has entered the country and are living in encampents and slums outside of many large cities.

### Religion
Lethania, having sided with the [[Corridor]] during the [[Lethanian War of Separation]], was strongly influenced by the [[Revelationary Revolution|Apocalyptic Movement]] hence most of its population is a member of one of the [[Asynodal Churches of Iomedae]]. Most of these churches abide by the [[Dimmerschluß Creed]], but exceptions are not uncommon.

With the advent of the [[Nachýrian Exodus]], [[Vahamut]] is commonly worshiped by the [[Kovold|Kobolds]] that have entered the country.

### Politics
Since the [[Lethanian War of Separation]] (1742 - 1745), Lethania has been governed by a parliament, with Chair (Voorzitter) of the Parliament formally leading the country.

In the past, rulership of Lethania (when still unified with modern day [[Polovina]]) was determined by the [[Great Joust]]. The Joust still exists, but now only functions as a feast day.

Lethania has close ties with both [[Ilmbund]] and the [[Vareshian Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] of [[Tel Varesh]]. Together with the latter, they organized the [[Lethanian-Vareshian Expeditions]] as part of their war against the [[Murænai]].
