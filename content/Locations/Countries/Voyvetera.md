# Voyvetera
Voyvetera is a relatively unknown country to beyond the [[Strait of Drakul]] to the nort-west of the [[Crucible]]. The country is known to have a sizable population of [[Halfling|Halflings]], ethnically and culturally distinct from the [[Yádor|Yádorian]] [[Halfling|Halflings]].

While note the capital, [[Voievodmare]] is probably the most well known of the Voyveteran cities. This large port city in the [[Strait of Drakul]], links the [[Rime Sea]] to the [[Withershin Ocean]], and is an occasional stop of Ships that can pay the high stipends for dropping anchor there.
