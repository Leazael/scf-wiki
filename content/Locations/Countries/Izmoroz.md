# Izmoroz 
The Grey Empire (Het Grauwe Rijk)

### Summary
One of the [[Sosulkan]] countries together with [[Las]]. A large state on the western side of the [[Crucible]]. Has long resided in a medieval stasis, but has recently started a path of rapid progression since Czar [[Koschei the Deathless]] was succeeded by Czar [[Ivan I Czarovitch]].

After centuries of decline, Izmoroz is once again on the rise. With the dead of [[Koschei the Deathless]], who was succeeded by the hitherto unknown Czar [[Ivan I Czarovitch]] in 1749 many progressive reforms have tried to push the empire into the 18th century. A large railway from [[Drysfurt]] and [[Ornsheill]], underneath the [[Fomorian Mountains]] has linked the cities of [[Philosophical Powers]] with the Grey Empire.

The capital city [[Sosulka]] is after [[Holmgard]] perhaps the oldest city in the [[Crucible]] and used to house one of embassies of the [[Shining Academy]].

Izmoroz shares a border with the [[Vareshian Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] of [[Tel Varesh]], [[Nachýr]] (separated by the [[Nemedian Mountains]]); [[Dalriada]], [[Lethania]], [[Polovina]] (separated by the [[Fomorian Mountains]] and [[Las]], from which it is partially separated by the [[Czar's Crown Mountains]].

The landlocked [[Blighted Sea]] (Venijnzee) yields edible fish, but the water is toxic.

### History
In the year 574 AR (142 BF), west of the [[Fomorian Mountains]] at the shores of what is now called the [[Blighted Sea|Poisoned Sea]], a young commoner named [[Koschei the Deathless|Koschei]] rose to power among the humans settled in that region. Within 50 years he had carved out what would become the oldest empire in the [[Crucible]], [[Izmoroz]], and came to be known as [[Koschei the Deathless]].

Over the course of the next 150 years, [[Izmoroz]] expanded its borders until it started crossing the [[Fomorian Mountains]] to the north and the [[Nemedian Mountains]] to the south.

In response to the ever growing power of Czar [[Koschei the Deathless|Koschei]] and the [[Yádor|Yádorian]] Hordes, several of the elder families that ruled the lands near [[Holmgard|Lethan]] joined forces to form the [[Lethania|Lethanian]] Confederacy in the year 0 AF.

In 577 AF, the Dragon Empire of [[Nachýr]], ruled by the dread empress [[Tiamat]], an ancient black dragon, had advanced far enough to the north-east that it started clashing with [[Izmoroz]] south of the most southern borders of the [Nemedian Mountains]. The resulting war has since been called the "[[War of Frozen Chains]]", named after the battlefields littered with the frozen corpses of [[Tiamat|Tiamat’s]] slave soldiers. This dreadful war raged for over a dozen years, from 566 AF until 581 AF. 

Even though [[Nachýr]] suffered heavy losses, [[Tiamat]] managed to wrest a large amount of land south of the [[Nemedian Mountains]] from the hands of [[Koschei the Deathless|Koschei the Immortal]]. 

A catastrophe shook the [[Crucible]] in the winter of 697 AF. A terrible blizzard enveloped the entire region of the Crucible followed by a winter that lasted for over a year: "The [[Year Without Dawn]]". After 14 months of freezing weather, the Northern reaches of Izmoroz were virtually devoid of life, except for a few lone cities, who by then had sworn fealty to their newly arrived rulers: The [[Princesses of Las|IIce Queens]] of [[Las]].

Every attempt of [[Koschei the Deathless|Koschei]] to reclaim these lands was met with grave disaster. No less than three armies were sent to deal with the usurping [[Princesses of Las|Queens]], but each of these armies were plagued by famine, predators and worse, and were decimated by the time they even arrived at the borders of the newly established country of Las.

After a reign of a thousand years, [[Koschei the Deathless]], who was succeeded by an unknown nobleman, [[Ivan I Czarovitch]] in 1749. What has happened to [[Koschei the Deathless|Czar Koschei]] is remains a mystery.

### Races
Mainly [[Human|Humans]], though [[Troll|Trolls]], [[Ork|Orcs]], [[Goblin|Goblins]] and other monstrous humanoids are not uncommon. As such, Izmoroz has one of the highest populations of [[Half-Ork|Half-Orcs]] of any country in the [[Crucible]] proper, and only the [[Vareshian Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] of [[Tel Varesh]]  having more. 

As nearly everywhere, [[Elf|elves]] and [[Half-Elf|half-elves]] are rare.

Since the [[Nachýrian Exodus]] in 1769 a sizable minority of [[Kovold|Kobolds]] has entered the country and are living in encampents and slums outside of many large cities.

Some [[Dwarf|dwarven]] clans still reside in the [[Fomorian Mountains]], on the border with [[Polovina]] as well as in the mountains near the [[Withershin Ocean]].

In the far north west, [[Halfling]] originating from [[Voyvetera]], across the [[Strait of Drakul]] make up as much as 10% of the population.

### Religion
Mainly [[Iomedae]] is worshipped, with most churches belonging to one of the [[Sosulkan Churches of Iomedae]], which is centrally organized from the capital [[Sosulka]]. A few scattered [[Asynodal Churches of Iomedae|Asynodal Churches]] can be found within [[Sosulka]], but virtually none outside.

In the parts of Izmoroz nort-west of the [[Blighted Sea]], the [[Old Sosulkan Gods]] are still commonly worshiped, with some villages not even having heard of [[Iomedae]].

The [[Dwarf|dwarves]] in the [[Fomorian Mountains]] still venerate the [[Æsir]], though their western cousins from near the [[Withershin Ocean]] worship their own, stranger gods.

### Government
Izmoroz is ruled autocratically by Czar [[Ivan I Czarovitch]], who despite his [[Natural Philosophy|philisophical]]  progressiveness, is not convinced of the merits of democracy. Most of the administration falls to the [[Boyar]], the aristocracy that has traidtionall governed Izmoroz.
