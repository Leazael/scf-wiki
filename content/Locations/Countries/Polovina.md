# Polovina 
The Grand Duchy of Polovina.
(Groothertogdom Polovina)

The Grand Duchy of Polovina is a country formed from the former [[Lethania|Lethanian]] provinces of [[Fenwald]] and [[Væringard]] and sizable parts of [[Thurandir]] after the [[Lethanian War of Separation]]. It was later expanded to include areas formerly part of south-eastern [[Las]], in particular [[Pyelchek]].

### Summary
Polovina us a militaristic autocratic government ruled by [[Grand-Duchess Adelheid Denris-Bern]] who succeeded her father Siegfried 12 years ago. It maintains the old tradition of the [[Great Joust]], which is consistently consistently won by the Wyvern-riding branch of the Unified House of Denris-Bern.

The capital of [[Polovina]] is the city of [[Drysfurt]]. The primary language spoken in Polovina is [[Ildarin]], though [[Sosulkan]] is more common in the western part of the country. It is considered one of the [[Philosophical Powers]]

[[Lethania]] and Polovina used to be part of the Lethanian Confederacy, but have split since the [[Lethanian War of Separation]]. Its former capital, [[Holmgard]] was effectively destroyed during the [[Cacotopic Warp]]. (1745) During the [[Lethanian War of Separation]], it allied with [[Arcadia]] and were collectively known as the [[Allied Forces]].

Polovina shares a border with [[Las]], [[Izmoroz]], [[Lethania]] and [[Dvårgheim]].

## History
Polovina was formed in 1745 in the wake of the [[Lethanian War of Separation]], which ended with the [[Peace of Weißenfels]], which officially recognized the newly formed Polovian Sovereignty. 

In 1757 [[Pyelchek]] finds itself without a [[Princesses of Las|princess]] and is quickly absorbed by Polovina. With the addition of these [[Las|Lassian]] territories, Polovina now styles itself as a Grand Duchy.

In 1769, while [[Lethania|Lethanian]] and [[Arcadia|Arcadian]] borders were quickly overrun by the migrating hordes of [[Kovold|Kobolds]] form [[Nachýr]] during the [[Nachýrian Exodus]], Polovina fortified its borders aggressively and managed to redirect most of these migrating kobolds towards [[Ilmbund]].

### Races
The population of the Polovina consists for the most part of [[Human|Humans]]. Both the eastern- and western-most parts have a sizable minority of [[Dwarf|Dwarves]], mainly the descendants of immigrants from [[Dvårgheim]] and the [[Fomorian Mountains]] respectively.

In the formerly [[Las|Lassian]] areas near [[Pyelchek]] and [[Lagushka]], there are relatively more [[Half-Ork|Half-Orcs]].  

Polovina has harshly kept any migrating [[Kovold|Kobolds]] away from its borders, following the [[Nachýrian Exodus]] in 1769.

### Religion
As part of the [[Allied Forces]] during the [[Lethanian War of Separation]], it resisted [[Revelationary Revolution|Apocalyptic]] influences and as a consequence the [[Synodal Church of Iomedae]] is still the dominant religion, with the [[Sosulkan Churches of Iomedae]] more prominent in the east and the [[Orthodox Synodal Church of Iomedae]] more prominent in the west.

[[Polovina]] has actively outlawed all [[Asynodal Churches of Iomedae|asynodal churches]] that do no abide by the [[Dimmerschluß Creed]].

On the northern shores of former [[Thurandir]], as well as in towns and cities with large [[Dwarf|Dwarven]] and [[Dvårgheim|Dvårgian]] populations, [[Æsir]] worship is tolerated.

### Religion
Polovina is a feudal aristocratic society where the pecking order is determined every few years during the [[Great Joust]]. 

Polovina has close ties with [[Arcadia]] and [[Izmoroz]], and is on good terms with most [[Las|Lassian]] city states. Apart from the intervention of several Polovian [[Synodal Church of Iomedae|Synodal Clergy]] during the [[Thanatogenic Ghost Storm]] in 1762, it has maintained a strictly isolationist diplomacy.
