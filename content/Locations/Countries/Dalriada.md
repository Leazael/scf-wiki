# Daldriada
Dalriada is a mysterious realm on a high plateau, hidden among the peaks where the [[Fomorian Mountains]] and [[Nemedian Mountains]] meet. The realm is officially led by the Dalriadan High-Priest, the Abbot of the Abbey of Dalriada, who lives in the fortress city of [[Mag Argatn√©l]]. This Abbey is in fact a collection of smaller monasteries spread throughout the country, most of them containing small druid-circles that meditate among the sparse sacred groves spread throughout the little kingdom. The ultimate goal of these druids is to find enlightenment and unity with the world around them.  

Most of the common folk live off and near these monasteries and their surrounding lands. These families usually offer a single child for membership of one of these monasteries.  

After the death of the Abbot, a group of priests set out in order to find the new Abbot, believing him to have reincarnated in a child born on the day after the passing of the old Abbot.

### Races
The population of Dalriada consists for the most part of [[Human|Humans]]. [[Half-Elf|Half-elves]] are exceptionally common, comprising almost 5% of the population. A notably large group of elves live in Dalriada consisting of almost 30 individuals.

### Religion

### Government
The country is ruled by the Abbot: the High-Priest of Dalriada.
