# Yádor
The Grassy Hell (Grashel), The Grassy Sea (Graszee)

Yádor is a land of few resources and plenty willing to fight for them. Yádorians are renowned riders and a person without a mount is considered no more than an animal. 

While the [[Human]] clans of Yádor usually travel on horseback, the clans of [[Halfling|Halflings]] prefer to ride the feathered deinonychi that can be found on the Yádorian steppes. Clans of both races also use larger dinosaurs as beasts of burden.

Yádor has a strong oral tradition of remembering the raids and heroism of their ancestors. Furthermore, it is a popular belief among Yádorians, especially among the lower castes, that the Yádorians are in fact dead and that the grassy expanse that is their country is in fact a cruel form of afterlife.

Over the last century [[Ilmbund]] has slowly expanded its borders westward past [[Raubmaul]], with the most sizable new city being [[Echsee]]. It was perhaps for this reason that in 1761 the Yádorian clans united, starting the first new mass invasion of the [[Crucible]] since [[Váida Khan]] in 1585. The Yádorians had not counted on the invention of the machine gun and the ensuing mass-death caused the [[Necromancy|necromantic]] event known as the [[Thanatogenic Ghost Storm]].

### Races 
While most of Yádor's population consists of [[Human|Humans]] almost 30% is made up of [[Halfling|Halflings]]. All other races are equally uncommon.

### Religion
While they are not considered deities, most Yádorians venerate their mounts. The Æsir are worshipped among some tribes, but practice various forms of animism and shamanism.

### Government
None. The population can be roughly divided into about a dozen hordes of hunter-gatherers that are each lead by one or more Khans. The most infamous of these was the great [[Váida Khan]], who invaded large parts of the [[Crucible]] in 1585, though they were eventually repelled leading to the [[Treaty of Ölmfurt]] and the founding of the fortress-city of [[Raubmaul]].
