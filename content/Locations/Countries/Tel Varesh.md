# Tel Varesh 

Tel Varesh is both the name of the (former) city-state as well as the collection of the semi-autonomous vassal states surrounding it. It lies west of [[Izmoroz]] and is mainly inhabited by [[Half-Ork|Orcs]], though with a sizeable minority of [[Human|Humans]] and [[Halfling|Hobgoblins]]

It still has a strong arcane magical tradition, which they refer to as [[Thaumaturgy]], due to its symbiotic ties with the [[Bondsmage|Bondsmagi]] of the [[Shining Academy]]. This art is still taught in at the [[High-Schul of Tel Varesh]].

It is elected by a council of representatives chosen by lottary, as wel as the Masked Priests of the [[Primal Ancestors]] (stamoudsten).

The Tel Vareshians practice [[Veneration of the Dead]].
