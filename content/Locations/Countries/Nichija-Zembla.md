# Nichija-Zembla
A far an strange country to the north of [[Yádor]] and east of [[Thrjoskarland]]. Very little is known abot this land, though it it is reported to be home to a nomadic people quite similar to the [[Thrjoská]], as well as [[Giant|Giants]].

The land is also said to be roamed by many [[Spirit Bears|giant animals]].

Supposedly, the direwolves ridden by [[House Denris]] may have originally hailed form Nachija-Zembla.
