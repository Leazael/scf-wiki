# Summary 
A collection of city-states in the north-western parts of the [[Crucible]]. It is considered one of the two [[Sosulkan]] states, together with [[Izmoroz]]. Every city is autocratically governed by one of the mysterious [[Princesses of Las|princess]]. 

These [[Princesses of Las|princesses]] appeared simultaneously over one thousand years ago in an event called "The Year Without Dawn", which lasted rom 697 to 698 AF. In subsequent years, every attempt of [[Koschei the Deathless]] to reclaim these lands was met with grave disaster. No less than three armies were sent to deal with the usurping [[Princesses of Las|princesses]], but each of these armies were plagued by famine, predators and worse, and were decimated by the time they even arrived at the borders of the newly established country of Las.

Ever since, these [[Princesses of Las|princesses]] have ruled the various city-states of Las, apparently un-aging and eternal, although many stories circulate about these [[Princesses of Las|princesses]] in their youth.

[[Lagushka]] and [[Pyelchek]] used to be Lassian territories, but after the disappearance of the [[Princesses of Las|princesses]], they have ben annexed by [[Polovina]].

The primary language of Las is [[Sosulkan]], though [[Ildarin]] is often spoken near the border with [[Polovina]]. 

While Las does not have a centralized government, its largest city, [[Yutzenka]] is often considered the de-facto capital, as the [[Princesses of Las|Princess]] of [[Yutzenka]] is sometimes willing to speak on behalf of her "sisters".

# Races
The population of Las consists for the most part of [[Human|Humans]]. The forests themselves house various lesser common species, like [[Ork|Orcs]], [[Goblin|Goblins]] and [[Troll|Trolls]].

# Religion
Mainly [[Iomedae]] is worshipped, with most churches belonging to one of the [[Sosulkan Churches of Iomedae]]. A few scattered [[Asynodal Churches of Iomedae|Asynodal Churches]] can be found, especially within the cities.  In remote villages, in the North and in the West of [[Las]], many still revere the [[Old Sosulkan Gods]], sometimes even alongside [[Iomedae]] or the [[Ã†sir]]. The latter are also worshiped by the native [[Dwarf|Dwarves]], near the [[Fomorian Mountains]]. Las is notoriously superstitious and people hold local nature spirits in high regard.

# Government
Las does not have a centralized government. 

While the [[Princesses of Las]] rule in theory, in practice they usually take little interest in actually governing, leaving this to either the [[Boyar]] or other councils, differing from city to city.
