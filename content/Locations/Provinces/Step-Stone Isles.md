# Step-Stone Isles
(De Stapstenen)

The Step-stone isles is the name for the archipelago dividing the Shimmering Straights from the [[Wilted Ocean]] and the [[Our-Valiant-Lady Sea]].

The westernmost isles are controlled by [[Lethania]] and contain the port city of [[Eydesburg]]. The eastern isles are controlled by [[Arcadia]] and contain the port cities of [[Providence]] and [[Sallysport]].

In the past, the isles were disputed between [[Arcadia]] and [[Nach√Ωr]], but after the intervention of [[Lethania]] in 1728-1729 they became a [[Lethania|Lethanian]] owned buffer zone between the constantly warring powers.
