# Averion
The province of Averion is the smallest province of [[Lethania]], having lost much territory to [[Arcadia]] during the [[Lethanian War of Separation]]. Its largest city, [[Angelenpoort]] (formerly Angelport) is the largest seaport of [[Lethania]] is only outdone by the [[Arcadia|Arcadian]] city of [[Covenant]] in the [[Crucible]].

It has however gained a large amount of land in the form of the [[Lethania|Lethanian]] [[Step-Stone Isles]], which it governs.

While historically having strong ties with [[Arcadia]] and the [[Synodal Church of Iomedae]], it was one of the three [[Lethania|Lethanian]] where the [[Revelationary Revolution]] was successful, abolishing its feudal system in favour of a parliamentary one in 1731.

The [[House Brightshield|Brightshield family]] family sided with [[Arcadia]] and the [[Allied Forces]] during the [[Lethanian War of Separation]]. It still rules the city of [[Maidenshrine]] and its surrounding lands.

### History
During the fourth [[Crusade]] (1656 - 1663) the people of [[Arcadia]] were slowly starving, while all the available food was send to the front lines of the war. After a seven year long [[Crusade]] it was decided by [[Lethania]] and [[Ilmbund]] that this [[Crusade]] should come to an end. They rallied their forces against those of [[Arcadia]] and slowly drove the [[Arcadia|Arcadian]] armies back from [[Nach√Ωr]] towards [[Arcadia]]. In addition, it was decided that a large part of [[Arcadia|Arcadian]] territory would be transferred to Lethania, as an independent province, ruled by a more [[House Brightshield|peaceful branch]] of the Arcadian royal family. 

In the wake of the [[Lethanian War of Separation]], much Averion re-joined [[Arcadia]], including [[Maidenshrine]] and its ruling family, [[House Brightshield]].
