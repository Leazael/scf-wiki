Hèrlmersc is a province of [[Lethania]] containing the eponymous marshland known as the Hèrlmersc. 

It also the richest province, due to the combination of the rich [[Miasma]] deposits, as well as its position on the trade routs by the [[Wilted Ocean]]. The province also contains [[Lethania]]'s current capital [[Eldmere]], which is the home of the influential [[LoeterCo]] corporation.

Originally, the Hèrlmersc was ruled by [[House Arkys]]. However, the the Hèrlmersc was the original point of origin for the [[Revelationary Revolution|Revelationary Movement]], and was the first government to move to a democratic system during the [[Revelationary Revolution]]. The [[House Arkys|Arkys]] family has since moved to to more regular commercial interest, mainly focussed on the [[Lethanian Colonies]], and the [[Fort Arkys|port city]] that still carries their name.

A feature of considerable interest are the [[Æthermills]], which are large mysterious structures that dot the landscape of the south-western parts of the marshlands. 

The land is also known for its large public transportation network of boats, traditionally tugboats, though most have since been modernized to use [[Miasma]] engines.
