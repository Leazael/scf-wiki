# Thurandir

Thurandir was a former province of [[Lethania]]. However, after the [[Lethanian War of Separation]], the province split, with the more rural north-western parts joining [[Polovina]], and its more cosmopolitan south-eastern parts, including its former capital [[Klingeborn]] joining the new [[Lethania|Lethanian Republic]].

Its former ruling house, the [[House Eburin|Eburin]] family (known for their winged boars), is now a part of [[Polovina|Polovian]] nobility.
